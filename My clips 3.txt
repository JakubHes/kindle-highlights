associative group influence is more complex. This strategy requires that you link your product to a certain societal group, while often alienating others. This can be done in two ways, either by (1) closely associating your product with the target group through advertising that specifically appeals to the attitudes and values of that group, or by (2) disassociating your product from other groups within society, in order to make it appear more accepted, or, in the cases of younger audiences, simply more “cool.”

Does your product lend itself to using the human need to belong appeal? If it does, don’t just think about ways to describe its features and benefits. Put at least equal effort into telling your prospects how buying your product makes them (aspirational), keeps them (associative), or helps them show the world that they’re not a part of a particular group (dissociative).

STAGE ONE: Precontemplation—People in this stage are either ignorant of your product’s existence—“What the heck is a Bloopo Burger?”—or they’re unaware they need it.  STAGE TWO: Contemplation—Prospects in this stage are aware of your product and have thought about using it. “Hmmm...I should check out those Bloopo Burgers someday.”  STAGE THREE: Preparation—This is the planning phase. Your prospect is thinking about buying from you, but needs more information about your product’s benefits and advantages. “I’d like to buy a Bloopo Burger...it sure looks good, but what the heck is in it? Is it healthier? Better tasting? What’s it cost?”  STAGE FOUR: Action—Success! Your prospect has arrived at the coveted action, or purchase phase. “Here’s my credit card, gimme my damned Bloopo!”  STAGE FIVE: Maintenance—A nice place for your prospects to be. In this phase, your product has become part of their everyday lives.

Some of your prospects are in stage one, while others wouldn’t think of eating any other burger, in stage five. You have two options to tackle this: 1. Create ads that address all five stages. This lets your prospects focus on whatever stage is personally relevant to them. Simply include all the details someone would need to be fully informed about a product they might know little, if anything, about. 2. Create a series of ads that, throughout a period of time, progress from stage one to stage five. Stage one, therefore, introduces your product to the marketplace. Each successive ad builds upon the last, and can begin highlighting key features and benefits.

the Inoculation Theory is used to reinforce a consumer’s existing attitudes toward a product or service by presenting a “weak” argument that tricks the consumer into defending his position and therefore strengthening his attitude. The three steps are: 1. Warn of an impending attack. 2. Make a weak attack. 3. Encourage a strong defense.

By attacking your ideas and decisions (or brand preferences, as in this example), inoculation encourages you to use critical thought to defend them. Basically, it tricks you into thinking more deeply about your own position, which reinforces your thoughts and feelings.

Therefore, you should feature colorful charts and graphs, and facts, figures, and quotes from respected intellectuals and professionals.

YOU LEARNED that in order for your advertising to be successful, you must first be aware of what blocks your readers from understanding your message. YOU LEARNED that your readers don’t care about your big vocabulary, only what you can do for them. That means you use shorter words, sentences, and paragraphs. YOU LEARNED that advertising copy doesn’t have to follow all the rules of a college composition. Your copy has one job: to sell, Sell, SELL! YOU LEARNED how to use questions to draw people into your copy and keep them reading. Right? YOU LEARNED how to use pronouns, such as the words you and I to make your copy sound personal.

Don’t forget that just one female black widow can blow out four to nine egg sacs every summer, each containing up to 750 eggs incubating a fresh new load of up to 750 spiderlings in just 14 to 30 days. Worse still, each venomous arachnid lives—no, mates and breeds!—inside your home with your children and pets, for up to three full years! Try killing them yourself if you must, but think about this: If you miss killing just one egg-engorged female (or one of her hundreds of nearly microscopic crawling babies), you’ll suffer a full-blown arachnid infestation in no time! I’ve been at war with black widows for the past five years, and there’s nothing worse than feeling something crawling across your skin at night when you’re in bed. Well,

Why be just another person in your industry who does nothing new, nothing worth noting, nothing that gets people talking and buying?

Company A’s headline reads, “MUGGER STOPPER!” and features a close-up of a woman’s hand holding the product as if she were showing you the label. Yawn. I can’t think of another product that offers so much dramatic possibility, yet this company opted to show their product doing...er, nothing at all. Company B, on the other hand, was smart. Their headline, “Stop Muggers at the Push of a Button!” showed an illustration of a woman spraying a group of sleazy-looking attackers who surround her in a semicircle. Each of the thugs is shown in various stages of distress: on their knees, flat on the ground, coughing, grabbing their faces, screaming, and running away.

See what’s happening? The more ways you justify the purchase of your product, the more likely you’ll influence people to buy. So you take them by the hand and tell the whole story. You pile on the benefits (Length-Implies-Strength), show pictures to help them see it, slather on the testimonials (social proof), and back it up with a warranty (to quell fear). By the time you’re done, you have quite a convincing (and often lengthy) sales piece.

Drew: Well nothing! Advertising is not supposed to be entertainment! You may be entertained by it, but that’s not its purpose. It’s not a creativity contest. It’s not meant to grace the walls of the Louvre in Paris. It’s also not poetry, comedy, or a riddle to be figured out. Advertising is not about winning awards for being tricky, off-the-wall, or ingenious. Advertising—plain and simple—is about selling products and services.

But something doesn’t have to be clever or tricky to grab and hold a prospect’s attention. You don’t write copy to appeal to the masses that aren’t buyers for your product as a way to thank them for reading your ad! And those who are interested in the offer don’t need entertainment in order to buy. They need benefits. Facts. An offer. And reassurance that you’ll deliver what you promise.

To wrap up on the obligation piece, this is not “cold hearted”.

If Warren Buffett never became the investor he is today, billions of dollars would go to waste. By signing a giving pledge, he will do more for society by himself than thousands of workers combined. In addition, he can pay for thousands of people to pursue their own dream of working for charities. Just remember, without his donations they wouldn’t be able to work in the first place

Overachievement is Also Wasted Time: Given that our blog attracts a lot of overachievers, we think many will also recognize the damaging effects of overkill. It is incredibly inefficient to beat a dead horse when no more value can be extracted. As an example, if you score a 90% on a test and the person who receives a 100% obtains the same grade (an A) there is absolutely no point in trying to go to 100%. You should focus your efforts on another test and if 90% is achieved in each one, then move on. The same philosophy applies to business as well. If a specific demographic is no longer giving you the appropriate return on investment, you start looking for a new demographic, create a new product and adjust your strategy

If you’re really having a tough time gaining weight you can switch to more carbs vs. proteins but we would wager the vast majority will benefit from a protein based morning. Beyond the protein aspect we would choose fruits that are acidic. We have no science to back this up only experience.

Now you’ll have a pair of shoes that will last * at least* 5 years

Play Lie Detection: This is another immensely valuable skill. Being able to tell if a person’s statements are true or false. Instead of running around asking a billion questions to everyone you know we suggest adding this to your daily or weekly routine. You’re going to simply take a topic you know extremely well and ask a person (friend or new acquaintance) “Hey I don’t know anything about XXX can you tell me about it?” Then see how long it takes for them to start making up information. You’ll find that people do not want to admit to being wrong (everyone’s a genius) so you can build a rolodex of facial and body reactions when they go into “making up information” mode.

Hand Out Harmful Personal Information: No, we don’t mean you go out and give bad advice, instead you are finding out if you can trust person X. This means you take one piece of information that would be “bad” if people knew about it and see if it gets leaked. The trick is to make sure you only tell one person. The second trick, if you want to lean on the safe side, is to give out information that really isn’t true. By doing this you’ll be able to build up character qualities of people you trust. Most people are not trustworthy and this is absolutely fine for social interactions.But… It would be deadly if money is ever involved

Show them the before and after result… what your results looked like before and after their recommendation.

The key is to build a framework for why one may be better than the other and see if it fits your personality. That said we are saying one thing for sure. If you don’t learn to sell you’ll be significantly poorer financially and emotionally. If you can’t sell a product and can’t sell yourself to other people (going on dates or obtaining your first career position)… It won’t be easy

Wall Street (Synthesis) Make no mistake, Wall Street is also sales. When a real estate agent sells a house, he collects a fee based on a percentage of the total sale value of the home.

Our Current Best Recommendation: Broadly speaking we think focus should center around sectors that are growing rapidly. This means we would recommend M&A within sectors such as healthcare, technology, pharmaceuticals and energy. While many companies will have an M&A group that is broad (not sector focused) the reasoning is clear. If a sector has many new companies popping up left right and center, it is likely that these companies will either go public or be acquired. This means more deal activity which means more fees and more money for YOU

We’re going to use investment banking (M&A advisory) as the best example. Most people think investment banking revolves around “investing in stocks”… we call these people “uneducated”. Investment banking (M&A) means you sell a Company to another company and collect a fee. This is no different than real estate sales (you’re just selling a much more expensive item, a company vs. a home). You collect a fee based on a % of the total sale price… Just like a real estate agent. There are other aspects to investment banking but there are boutiques that *primarily* sell companies (not much else is offered). So we’ll go with a public example of a Company that focuses on the M&A side.Moelis60

Story, Example, Tell (“SET” Framework): The goal of your entire message is to relate to your specific target audience on an emotional level by telling your Story. After this you provide Examples of the benefits you found from the solution being offered… followed by Telling the audience the reason to buy and of course to click purchase. Once you understand the SET framework, you’ll see it everywhere. Get rich websites always have a story of a guy who was broke and in debt (targeting masses) and muscle building websites always go with the “I was skinny or I was fat” followed by the story and current look. This is how it should be done, and our framework is easy to remember. If you stick to the basic SET framework, you can then layer in more complex items and other sales tactics you’ve learned along the way

Influencers the Holy Grail of Sales: Okay maybe not the Holy Grail, but it is by far the highest ROI you can receive if you’re able to get your products into the hands of an influencer (automatic closed sales!). An influencer is someone with hundreds of thousands (even millions) of followers on a specific social platform. If they can validate your product by recommending it you’ll make an egregious ROI especially if you can get it on the cheap (offer influencers free products). The one catch, is that people are becoming more aware of “paid advertising”. So you’ll have to give up the product (take the loss) at an attempt to land a whale (influencer). If they can go to bat for the product without being paid to do so, you’ve hit pay dirt. While this is certainly not related to copywriting it is 1,000% related to sales. Keep a list of influencers in the back of your mind when you’re launching your product and remember to check (their followers) to make sure they are real

Stalk Your Competitors: Pay attention to your industry only. There is no reason to pay attention to other sectors (losing valuable time). Information can be gained when watching the advertisements of your competitors. You should visit their websites, read their ads, watch their social media accounts and track their web traffic. You’ll get a knack for understanding how much they are making, if they are buying traffic (lower profit margins) and what items are selling the best for them. While you won’t learn everything, you’ll certainly pick up a few new ideas to add to your current sales funnel. As a note, copying the competition is just not a good use of time. You’ve already seen copy-cat websites for content… It is even worse for products. There has to be something a tad unique (it can be the sales technique/branding if nothing else) but it just can’t be a regurgitated product. The difference between copying and learning from the competition? The strategy. Ask why it is being done that way and then ask if it will fit into your model. Sometimes it actually won’t! Just remember to focus on the strategy/messaging that they are using. As a final note, even though we’ve clearly stated copying won’t work. Thousands of people will try it anyway and they will burn valuable time trying to replicate something that doesn’t fit into their strategy/process correctly

Marketing Wins: Since you’re towards the end of this book you already know the answer: “Most products add minimal value and generate sales due to marketing”. Brand name products, status items and magic pills are lucrative businesses because people don’t want to do any actual work. The supplements industry is probably the worst as guys inject themselves with steroids and sell $50 bottles of XYZ product to build muscle when the steroids themselves cost significantly less than the fake bottles that “build muscle”. Why does it work? Well… people would rather take a “magic pill” than do actual work (heavy lifting, dieting) or even worse injecting a product “invasive process” (i.e.pain). Funny enough, that is exactly what they are doing to sell the bottles in the first place. In short, the product doesn’t need to add a lot of value. Your product simply needs to make the person feel good and avoid any sort of pain (do not try to convince people to do ANY actual work for ANY product: diet, skin, make money online etc

Split All Traffic: This is similar to “A/B” testing. If you’re going to launch a product you A/B test meaning you send one idea to one half and the other idea to the second half (within the same demographic). You then choose the one with the better response rate. You’ll do the same exact thing with all of your traffic since you’re going to watch it like a hawk. Figure out what type of user is converting on page A and if you find a trend then create a separate page to tweak for the second sales funnel. This is essentially a secondary “A/B” test. You’ve optimized correctly for the first group of people. Now you’re optimizing based on the results for when it goes live. Now you know why everyone talks about sales funnels in affiliate marketing.Note: you can also create a landing page where the person gets to the offer after * trying to leave* the page (many websites use this tactic)

Step 2) Avoid the Big Mistakes If you avoid big mistakes when you’re meeting new people you’ll see a step function improvement in your social life. Since you’re checked in and living in the present, here are the quickest improvement points: 1) Steer the conversation to the present moment. No one cares about the past or the future in a bar or nightclub. Focus on now. Structure conversations around observations of your surroundings. Other people interacting, the design of the venue, so on and so forth. Most women enjoy gossiping so making observations about others typically works well 2) Under no circumstances do you immediately ask for their name. In general, most will ask for your name particularly if you’re grabbing drinks already. In addition, try to avoid topics such as technology, work and politics. It can work… Just not very likely (besides none of those are interesting topics in a social setting anyway). Knowing information such as their name is a form of investment in the other person; you don’t care to know the name of a girl who hasn’t already shown interest (such as my asking your name). Discussing “serious” issues is a form of investment; you don’t care if a girl is on the path to several life mistakes unless she’s

Draw a line between the bathrooms and the bar and look around for the stair cases (if there are any). Stand in an area where people constantly walk by so you don’t have to run around. The line between the bar and the staircases/bathrooms are the traffic flow zones. The reason to stand in these areas is due to the fact that the pack separates. It is much more common to see people alone or in pairs as they move back and forth from these vortex zones. It’s a much higher ROI and is better than running around trying to talk to groups of 5+ who are fist pumping in a circle

Always start a conversation with an assumption. It doesn’t have to be great. Anything about the present moment and make sure it is not offensive or an outrageous undeserved complement.“Hey I bet that is XXX (specific assumption)” is just fine. An assumption works best because it makes a directional and tonal choice right away in the interaction, the question “How are you today?” could cause a girl to answer “Awesome” to “Terrible” and enter into an unhelpful context, as opposed to “That looks like XXXX which means you’re probably XXX. ” which gives her a positive attitude to adopt. Finally it takes more of the creative burden off her while shouldering it yourself, thus your interaction will feel as if it flows more, from her perspective

Step 3) Focus on Your Body Language and Clothing First Most worry about what to say to new people. Since we’ve already given that away with a basic assumption talking point, the bigger issue is typically how someone looks: 1) Dress as sharp as you can for the venue. If you’re wearing suits you should be in a nicer high end venue and it should fit extremely well (made to measure at minimum). If you’re in a lower end venue, nice jeans and shirts that show you’re in shape will work perfectly fine (you’re probably younger if you’re going to these venues where people over drink consistently)

If there is no one of interest at the moment, take a glance at the style of the guys who are chatting with girls you think are attractive (free chance to learn something). In the future, you will predict how well other men do with women and the dynamics of their relationships (lover vs.“kept boyfriend”) from style and body language alone. This will naturally help your standard assumption openers because you’ll end up being more and more accurate

Do not have any object sit in front of you while you’re standing. This means you’re not going to look at your phone (it would be placed in front of your chest) and it means your drinks are not going to be held in front of your chest (hold them to your side or set it on a bar/table).

Keep an open posture at all times. This means you do not cross your legs or your arms. Do not do anything that makes you look “closed up” which can also include hands in your pant pockets, coat pockets, head looking at the ground and head looking at your phone constantly. Closed posture is the easiest and most common issue. Most have closed postures because they are “uncomfortable” in the environment. Look no further than a dreaded office party to see closed posture on display

Do not “pre-sell” yourself. If she’s already responding then she’s already interested. Keep it casual and fast so you can get a day on the calendar before losing her interest 4) Once you're comfortable in conversations you can simply say "let’s go" when you're trying to move to another venue or go to your house/apartment 5) Remember that anything you send *will* be seen by her friends.

No need to do this and highlight it to them, simply leave bigger tips and they’ll notice without you telling them you did them a “favor”.

Also a good idea to use the observational skills and assumptions with the bouncers/doormen as well, these guys are often bored and commenting in a funny way on drunk people or girls is a good way to start and maintain a friendly relationship. They are typically 100x more interesting and valuable than “that guy from work” who you’ve been forced to drink with several times in the past 4) Make sure your wardrobe matches the venue which should be easy considering your personality already matches the area you’re in. Invest a few extra bucks building up a wardrobe for your regular venues. Also being slightly better dressed than the other guys is helpful for positive attention, whether this is by coordination or fit, or by going “one step up

Now that you’re used to socializing with strangers you’ll feel completely fine asking for phone numbers in the future. The best times to meet people are when you’re at a restaurant (showing up early as always), shopping for clothing or out grabbing groceries 4) The framework is quite simple. As you have noticed, we don’t use “specific lines” to sound like robots. Instead you should be in the venue for a reason. Simply say “what do you think about this or have you used this” and point/hold up product you’re talking about. After that you’ll talk for about 2x longer than you normally would at a nightlife venue, explaining why you’re interested in it and throw in a lot of details (filler) since direct talking does not work as well in day time environments. By talking for 2x longer than normal, there are several things that the person can grasp on to if they want to continue the conversation. If they do… well you continue down that path and eventually ask them if they live in the area (they likely do) and say you’d be interested in hanging out “this was fun we should hang out sometime”. Then as usual, hand them your phone (don’t ask for the phone number) they’ll typically just grab it and put in their information

Attractive women will have the option to be serial monogamists, as they do not have to accept “hook ups” since their market power allows them to set the price of their affection at whatever they want. These attractive women can also have discrete one night stands, so it is only the combination of good looks and a preference for strong bonding that would keep her out of the “hook up” pool

Don’t get legally married. If you decide to have a family do so without the government contract. Feel free to get the ring, have the ceremony and live together. Just don’t pay the higher tax rate and put yourself at risk to losing 50% of your assets at any time. You can also take the beneficial elements of marriage and construct those agreements yourself such as a health proxy for the medical rights of a spouse, survivor clause on real property, limited power of attorney etc. The main point is that a standard legal marriage comes with many negatives that an intelligent man would avoid, and a reasonable woman acting in good faith would be willing to avoid, and you can setup the agreements and general situation you want without the standard contract. If she is not okay with this idea, then you know what to do

Get in Shape: Step one is getting in good shape. There is no point in arguing about “looks”. Everyone can agree that looking good will do nothing but help you in dating and meeting people of importance. Humans are animals at the end of the day and we’re all biased to hang out with people that are physically more attractive. Ending any discussion about looks once and for all: looks, money and status are “passive game”, executing charisma is “active game”; the more you have of one the less you need of the other.“Passive game” expands your pool of prospects; “Active game” is how well you close them. Adjust Wardrobe: Once you’re in shape you’ll change your wardrobe and obtain fitting clothing. In a few years you should be able to afford a few made to measure suits (or custom suits) and if you’re starting out, something like Indochino or Suit Supply will work just fine. 2x a Week and Focus on Body Language: Going out 2x a week is more than enough. Go out on Thursday’s and Saturday’s. You’ll follow the outline listed above and improve on your overall social skills over time by talking to people using “assumption” openers.

If you’re in NYC we’ll bet you end up migrating towards the SoHo area. This will then make your life a lot easier as you incorporate talking to new people in your day to day life.

This is especially true in places like Eastern Europe/South East Asia.Remember, try to get RICH first, before deciding that its better abroad (you’ll be unsurprised to find that there is no real difference if you’re actually rich).

Benefits of a Relationship: Practically everyone will have a girlfriend during their 10 years of grind to accumulating a large amount of money (hopefully even less time!). That said there are a lot of benefits and to be clear, we’re not against dating a girl if you’re happy.Also, part of the shift in needing the girl the least is that she will be chasing you for a relationship, so if you’d like to continue to see other girls either casually and as it arises from your day to day interactions or in some sort of multiple long term arrangement, the ball is in your court.1) You’ll save money. If you meet a girl you like and she’s not a crazy person, then you’ll end up saving a lot more money. Not so much in cold hard cash, but quite a bit in time. Instead of going out until 3am in the morning twice a week you’ll be going out to dinner here and there or going to some sort of event.2) You’ll increase focus. With your schedule more stabilized you’ll be able to focus a lot more on your work. This means you’ll typically advance a lot further in any given time period when you’re in a stable relationship 3) You’ll get a better understanding of the girls you like. If a girl was interesting enough for you to put going out on hold for a period of time… there are a lot of characteristics that you like about her. Who knows if you will continue to date her in the future but it will give you a good glimpse of the qualities you like 4) By being in relationships here and there, you’ll decide if you want to have kids. This is a personal decision and we have no opinion on having kids. If you’d like to have kids great, if not… great as well. If you’re in a relationship that lasts more than 6 months or so, it’ll trigger you to think about your future

Relationships don’t take work. If the girl you’re dating demands too much time or too much of your resources either you’re not where you need to be financially or you are not that interested in the girl. If there is a lot of conflict all of the time just move on 2) Don’t expect any girl you date to be perfect. You should know the downsides of the girl you’re dating and decide if that is something your personality lines up well with. If a girl puts a lot of value in going to Broadway shows and dinner, then consider that a change in your lifestyle versus nightclubs and bars. If she’s more interested in going outdoors, then decide if you’re willing to adjust your social life to doing outdoor activities on a regular basis.3) The best advice for managing a relationship is “don’t ask for advice”. If you ask for advice on how to handle your own relationship then you’re going to lose the girl anyway. If you’re not willing to lose your girlfriend she’ll end up leaving you anyway. That is probably the most common mistake people make. It is also why we laugh when people pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars for relationship counseling 4) Make your lifestyle clear. If she doesn’t understand how you live your life, then you’ll create conflicts from day one. Make it clear and then see if she’s still interested. If not, it wasn’t going to work out anyway 5) Don’t let anything drag along. If you realize 3 months or 10 months down the line that it is not going to work, go ahead and end the relationship. It does not do you any favors and does not do her any favors as well. There is no reason to be nasty about it just separate on positive terms As you can see, there isn’t too much to add on relationships since this is too specific for each individual. If you find a girl you like that is attractive to you and fits your lifestyle well

Just remember the cardinal rule outlined at the beginning of this section “Whoever needs the other person the least is in control of the relationship”. Attractive women prefer strong men so by being needy or compliant with the demands of someone else over and over, that trait erodes (a huge negative). No woman on earth is interested in a needy guy who pines over a girl. This is also why there is no such thing as an ideal woman (doesn’t exist). If you find someone that fits your personality go ahead and run with it and don’t ask for advice

How to Tell If She Is Interested If you’ve followed the framework outlined in this book, you’ll be able to catch on very rapidly. The premise is quite simple: they will put themselves in the vicinity for something to “just happen”. This is essentially the equivalent of “girl game”. They don’t make the first moves and they like to say everything “just happened”. Knowing this alone it is pretty easy to see if the girl is interested

Eye contact is the most obvious form of showing interest. If you’re getting direct eye contact for more than a few seconds then you’re foolish to not say anything. You’re even more foolish if she is playing with her hair and giving you direct eye contact 2) Hovering. Ever notice the vast majority of attractive girls are found in nice areas (nice gyms, nice wine bars, nice restaurants, etc.). This is their way of putting themselves in a situation for something to happen. The same is true within the location. They will stand near or around the group of guys they are interested in talking to 3) Standing in photos. If you’re in group photos with some friends and one girl constantly ends up next to you in the photo… She’s again interested. You are foolish to miss it once and a bigger fool if you find 3-5 photos and the same girl is constantly trying to be next to you in the photo 4) Leaving reminders at your place. This should also be obvious, but if you have a group of people over and one girl consistently “forgets” something at your place… She didn’t forget it. She left it there to create another interaction with you. There are always exceptions but if the item is worth more than a few bucks it’s typically not a mistake 5) Pushing the conversation. Girls are able to talk about nothing for hours, so they can certainly help you continue a conversation. If you find a girl is constantly trying to elongate the time she is spending with you… take the hint yet again! 6) Physical touching. This is another clear one, but if you accidentally bump into a girl or she tries to face your direction when navigating a crowded are (doesn’t turn) then she’s likely interested as well. She can easily move or make a negative reaction… if she doesn’t mind the contact, she’s very likely interested 7) Out of the blue contact. Any time a past fling/girlfriend contacts you “out of the blue” that is practically a guarantee that she is trying to re-kindle the relationship. Particularly obvious when she makes a statement such as “looking at old photos of us!” 8) If she dangles her heels she’s ready to leave. Thought this one was obvious but most can’t tell when a girl is done hanging out and would prefer to hang out alone instead. If she begins high heel shoe dangling after being out for an adequate amount of time (at least a couple of hours) there is a high likelihood she wants to leave the area 9) Licking her lips. We’ve hilariously seen guys miss that queue, if you’re unable to figure that one out… probably need to get out more! 10) Response time. Everyone knows this one but we’ll go ahead and add it. The faster she responds the more interested she is. If you are forced to wait for long periods of time… Skip and go to someone else. Unless she’s on a flight or has some sort of extreme circumstances, practically everyone is glued to their smartphones these days

Reading/Learning: We’re going to limit this to ~1 hour a day.Why? Well, all of the actual reading and learning needs to be done with a purpose. We have nothing against reading and learning, we just don’t see anyone getting paid to read books. Reading is extremely important if you want to be successful, the problem is that it “feels” like you’re actually doing work (you’re not!). So read with a purpose for about an hour a day. After that the real work involves actual changes to your online store, buying traffic and watching your competition like a hawk to make sure you pick up on any new marketing/sales tactics to use yourself

Getting rich and feeling terrible all the time (looking terrible as well) defeats the entire purpose of getting rich in the first place. With an added time buffer for food/exercise, you’ll remain stress free as well (the biggest health killer in our opinion).Importantly, we’re not calculating the time you spend actually “eating”.

How to Avoid Burnout? The answer is realizing you don’t have time. As you’ve noticed this book was written for people between 20 and 40 or so. The reality is your body will slow down. Time waits for absolutely no one. So if you feel that you’re really burning out take a couple of days off (rest and turn off your brain) then get right back to it. If someone needs 3-6 months off to avoid burnout… they should go back to Elementary School. It is harsh but true. Someone else will work ~350 days out of the year and take the market away. The best way to avoid burnout is to recognize that time is going by and you’re going to have less energy 10 years from now (this applies if you are 20 or 30 or 40 etc.). As we outlined earlier, you’ll learn when your body needs to rest and when you can “push through the pain”. Once you strike the balance you’ll never feel burned

Second, we would then use two “tricks” the first one is rationalizing yourself out of depression. Being depressed does not get you anywhere. It is similar to complaining. While it feels like something real has happened (when a complaint is made) all it does it waste time and make you feel worse. Everyone goes through phases where they feel somewhat depressed, however, you’re going to fight through the mental fatigue by talking yourself through it.“This does nothing for me, all it does is reduce my performance”. If you go down the medical route, it is even worse, as you’ll believe that your happiness is tied to some sort of pill. The next and more extreme way to get out of depression is to record yourself complaining. When you do this you’ll cringe when you hear yourself complaining about the world and acting weak. We’ve found this tactic immediately gets you out of a funk. All of that said, we’re probably not the best people to ask when it comes to emotional support type questions.But. People have asked so that is our answer

How Do I Stay Focused? Step 1: Write Down One Task: This is pretty simple, every day you wake up and you write down the one thing that is most important to you. It should be no longer than one sentence long.“My #1 priority is X”. Now you won’t waste your time hitting the snooze button on the alarm because you have not done anything to progress on the most important item on your list. Don’t waste your time worrying about your other priorities, this will actually kill your focus. Instead you wake up and write down the one thing most important to your life and we have no right in saying what that item is. Some will say “build second source of income” for others it may be career related. So on and so forth. At this point the only thing you’re allowed to do is eat or drink something (get ready for the day) and don’t allow yourself to do anything until *progress* is made on the #1 item on your list.Finally, the phrase is not an “end-goal” the phrase needs to be set up as progress otherwise you’ll get sick of it rapidly. Step 2: Create a Reminder: The #1 item on your list should have a substantial reason behind it. You then want to create a visible item to look at on a daily basis as you progress. We are not sure what the reminder will be, that said, we prefer a personal quote made by yourself (not some motivational dude who doesn’t care about you and just wants your money). If the task is building up your second source of income then it could be something as simple as “Do I want to rely on someone else for my livelihood?” Place your personal reason in clear view when you sit down to start your task. In this clear example, before you get to do anything to start your day you’re going to be reminded that you’re relying on someone else to put food on your table. Not a good feeling and should spur on action. Step 3: You’re Not Allowed to Read: That’s right. Reading feels like you’re progressing but we’ve seen a total of Zero purchases made by books read. We’ve never seen someone purchase a Ferrari with “number of books read”. In fact, we don’t know a single time in history where a person reads a book and suddenly gets more money.Secondly, if the item is physical “I will lose123

Step 4: Remove All Noise: This is both literal and figurative. Unless the task requires phone calls (calling customers as an example) or access to the Internet at that specific moment, you should shut everything out. Take it to the extreme. As an example we prefer turning off our phones before starting to do real work and remove all tabs/browsers unrelated to real time work to prevent any distractions. This is actually a rare time where we can look to athletes as an example. If anyone has experience in competitive sports… thinking about anything but the present task is a recipe for disaster.

Step 5: Create a Mental Zone: At this point you’re about to start the task. You’ve already recognized it as the most important to you, you’ve already reminded yourself (utilizing fear) as to why you need to accomplish the task and finally, you’re in a place where you cannot be distracted by any means. Now comes the fun part of creating a “zone” or focus point. The final step before starting is to remind yourself of a previous success. It does not matter what it is, just choose the biggest achievement that you remember (or one of the biggest) and lock into that time frame. After walking through it in your head as if watching a movie (should take a minute or two) you’re going to repeat the task and remember being “in the zone”. This is also more commonly known as neuro linguistic programming, but, we’ll try to take it a step further. Once you have played the event in your head once or twice… the final time, instead of remembering the event, remember the mental state you were in. Try to remember what you were thinking of during the event. You’ll find out the exact same thing. You were not thinking about anything. Ever wonder why we refer to people that are in the zone as being “unconscious”, well now you know

Step 7: All Out or Full Speed: Since our bodies and brains get tired over time the best way to progress is at full speed until exhausted. Since this is hands down the most important task to you, you’ll need to continue in this zone until you lose the mental ability to continue.

Like any other servo-mechanism, it must have a clear-cut goal, objective, or “problem” to work on. The goals that our own Creative Mechanism seeks to achieve are mental images, or mental pictures, which we create by the use of imagination. The key goal-image is our self-image. Our self-image prescribes the limits for the accomplishment of any particular goals. It prescribes the “area of the possible.”

Once, however, a correct or “successful response” has been accomplished, it is “remembered” for future use. The automatic mechanism then duplicates this successful response on future trials.

The precise action steps will come to you without stress, tension, or worry about how you are going to accomplish the result you seek.

You must learn to trust your Creative Mechanism to do its work and not “jam it” by becoming too concerned or too anxious as to whether it will work or not, or by attempting to force it by too much conscious effort. You must “let it” work, rather than “make it” work. This trust is necessary because your Creative Mechanism operates below the level of consciousness, and you cannot “know” what is going on beneath the surface. Moreover, its nature is to operate spontaneously according to present need. Therefore, you have no guarantees in advance. It comes into operation as you act and as you place a demand on it by your actions. You must not wait to act until you have proof—you must act as if it is there, and it will come through. “Do the thing and you will have the power,” said Emerson.

Instead of trying hard by conscious effort to do the thing with ironed-jawed willpower, and all the while worrying and picturing to yourself all the things that are likely to go wrong, you simply relax the strain, stop trying to do it by strain and effort, picture to yourself the target you really want to hit, and let your creative Success Mechanism take over. Thus, mentally picturing the desired end result literally forces you to use “positive thinking.” You are not relieved thereafter from effort and work, but your efforts are used to carry you forward toward your goal, rather than in the futile mental conflict that results when you want and try to do one thing, but picture to yourself something else.

Great living starts with a picture, held in your imagination, of what you would like to do or be.” Your present self-image was built on your own imagination pictures of yourself in the past, which grew out of interpretations and evaluations that you placed on experience. Now you are to use the same method to build an adequate self-image that you previously used to build an inadequate one. Set aside a period of 30 minutes each day when you can be alone and undisturbed. Relax and make yourself as comfortable as possible. Now close your eyes and exercise your imagination.

The important thing is to make these pictures as vivid and as detailed as possible. You want your mental pictures to approximate actual experience as much as possible. The way to do this is to pay attention to small details, sights, sounds, objects, in your imagined environment.

Details of the imagined environment are all-important in this exercise, because for all practical purposes, you are creating a practice experience. And if the imagination is vivid enough and detailed enough, your imagination practice is equivalent to an actual experience insofar as your nervous system is concerned.

The next important thing to remember is that during this 30 minutes you see yourself acting and reacting appropriately, successfully, ideally. It doesn’t matter how you acted yesterday. You do not need to try to have faith you will act in the ideal way tomorrow. Your nervous system will take care of that in time—if you continue to practice. See yourself acting, feeling, “being,” as you want to be. Do not say to yourself, “I am going to act this way tomorrow.” Just say to yourself: “I am going to imagine myself acting this way now—for thirty minutes today.”

This exercise builds new “memories” or stored data into your mid-brain and central nervous system. It builds a new image of self. After practicing it for a time, you will be surprised to find yourself “acting differently,” more or less automatically and spontaneously—without trying. This is as it should be. You do not need to try or make an effort now in order to feel ineffective and act inadequately. Your present inadequate feeling and doing is automatic and spontaneous because of the memories, real and imagined, you have built into your automatic mechanism. You will find it will work just as automatically on positive thoughts and experiences as on negative ones.

When you begin, it’s good to scan your body for tension and begin to consciously relax your head, torso, waist, legs, and so on. And, as strange as it may sound, allow yourself to “smile” into your brain and body, which greatly helps you relax. As you begin to relax, concentrate on breathing deeply. Follow your inhale and your exhale. Allow positive energy to enter as you exhale the negative.

Dunlap found that either “positive practice” (refraining from the habit) or “negative practice” (performing the habit consciously and voluntarily) would have beneficial effect provided the desired end result was kept constantly in mind. “If a response habit is to be learned, or if a response pattern is to be made habitual,” Dr. Dunlap wrote in Personal Adjustment, “it is essential that the learner shall have an idea of the response that is to be achieved or shall have an idea of the change in the environment that the response will produce. . . .

Our errors, mistakes, failures, and sometimes even our humiliations, were necessary steps in the learning process. However, they were meant to be means to an end—and not an end in themselves. When they have served their purpose, they should be forgotten. If we consciously dwell on the error, or consciously feel guilty about the error and keep berating ourselves because of it, then—unwittingly—the error or failure itself becomes the “goal” that is consciously held in imagination and memory.

A businessman friend of mine had a very similar experience. A failure at 40, he continually worried about “how things would come out,” about his own inadequacies, and whether or not he would be able to complete each business venture. Fearful and anxious, he was attempting to purchase some machinery on credit, when the seller’s wife objected. She did not believe he would ever be able to pay for the machinery. At first his hopes were dashed. But then he became indignant. Who was he to be pushed around like that? Who was he to skulk through the world, continually fearful of failure? The experience awakened “something” within him—some “new self”—and at once he saw that this woman’s remark, as well as his own opinion of himself, was an affront to this “something.”

The other “activity” that often leads to creative insights is sleeping. If you have a question you’d like an answer to, or a project you’re working on that you’d like to accomplish with greater ease, you can instruct your mind before going to bed to be open to useful information and to remember it upon awakening. Keeping a notepad and pen on your nightstand to record the insights as they come is a good idea. When you use this approach, you can quickly find yourself getting ideas that greatly surpass anything that comes to you while awake.

People who want to improve their financial situation must heed the same advice. If you continually obsess about where you are as well as where you want to be financially, you’re less likely to get there. Program the goal—then get busy on the process—and if you don’t know the process yet, give yourself space to allow the process of “how” to come to you.

When we feel jittery, or worried, or anxious in thinking of the great amount of work that lies before us, the jittery feelings are not caused by the work, but by our mental attitude—which is “I ought to be able to do this all at once.” We become nervous because we are trying to do the impossible, and thereby making futility and frustration inevitable.

The truth is: We can only do one thing at a time. Realizing this, fully convincing ourselves of this simple and obvious truth, enables us to mentally stop trying to do the things that lie next, and to concentrate all our awareness, all our responsiveness, on this one thing we are doing now. When we work with this attitude, we are relaxed, we are free from the feelings of hurry and anxiety, and we are able to concentrate and think at our best.

In the meantime, you can induce something of “that relaxed feeling,” and the relaxed attitude, while going about your daily activities, if you will form the habit of mentally remembering the nice relaxed feeling that you induced. Stop occasionally during the day, it need only take a moment, and remember in detail the sensations of relaxation. Remember how your arms felt, your legs, back, neck, face. Sometimes forming a mental picture of yourself lying in bed, or sitting relaxed and limp in an easy chair, helps to recall the relaxed sensations. Mentally repeating to yourself several times, “I feel more and more relaxed,” also helps.

Invariably, they are disappointed. Happiness is a mental habit, a mental attitude, and if it is not learned and practiced in the present it is never experienced. It cannot be made contingent upon solving some external problem. When one problem is solved, another appears to take its place. Life is a series of problems.

Looking back on my own life I can see that some of the happiest years were those when I was struggling through as a medical student, and living from hand to mouth in my early days of practice. Many times I was hungry. I was cold and ill-clad. I worked hard a minimum of about 12 hours a day. Many times I did not know from month to month where the money was coming from to pay my rent. But I did have a goal. I had a consuming desire to reach it, and a determined persistence that kept me working toward it.

I related all this to the young business executive and suggested that the real cause of his unhappy feeling was not that he had lost $200,000, but that he had lost his goal; he had lost his aggressive attitude, and was yielding passively rather than reacting aggressively. “I must have been crazy,” he told me later, “to let you convince me that losing the money was not what was making me unhappy—but I’m awfully glad that you did.” He stopped moaning about his misfortune, “faced about,” got himself another goal—and started working toward it. Within five years he not only had more money than ever before in his life, but for the first time he was in a business that he enjoyed.

PRACTICE EXERCISE Form the habit of reacting aggressively and positively toward threats and problems. Form the habit of keeping goal-oriented all the time, regardless of what happens. Do this by practicing a positive aggressive attitude, both in actual everyday situations that come up, and also in your imagination. See yourself in your imagination taking positive, intelligent action toward solving a problem or reaching a goal. See yourself reacting to threats, not by running away or evading them, but by meeting them, dealing with them, grappling with them in an aggressive and intelligent manner. “Most people are brave only in the dangers to which they accustom themselves, either in imagination or practice,” said Bulwer-Lytton, the English novelist.

In thinking of the present, I would deliberately turn my attention to its desirable elements, my home, the opportunities my solitude gave me to work, and so on, and I resolved to make the utmost use of these opportunities and to ignore the fact that they seemed to lead to nothing. In thinking of the future I determined to regard every worthy and possible ambition as within my grasp. Ridiculous as this seemed at the time, in view of what has come to me since, I see that the only defect of my plan was that it aimed too low and did not include enough.

Professor Elmer Gates’s practice of calling up “pleasant ideas and memories” is one of the most important aspects of Psycho-Cybernetics. When we fail to recall our good moments, our best times, it’s as if we’ve been disconnected from the source of all things good. But as soon as we remember and feel what it was like to be at our best, the switch is turned back on. We are reconnected—and we start experiencing bliss internally and externally. Our thoughts are not only positive, so are our feelings—and oddly enough, most of the circumstances we encounter that would have been negative in the past are now pleasant, harmonious, and vibrant.

A man who will not take a chance on himself must bet on something. And the man who will not act with courage sometimes seeks the feeling of courage from a bottle.

Another helpful suggestion is to practice acting boldly and with courage in regard to “little things.” Do not wait until you can be a big hero in some dire crisis. Daily living also requires courage—and by practicing courage in little things, we develop the power and talent to act courageously in more important matters.

Successful personalities have some interest in and regard for other people. They have a respect for others’ problems and needs. They respect the dignity of human personality and deal with other people as if they were human beings, rather than as pawns in their own game. They recognize that every person is a child of God and is a unique individual who deserves some dignity and respect. It is a psychological fact that our feelings about ourselves tend to correspond to our feelings about other people. When a person begins to feel more compassion about others, he invariably begins to feel more compassion toward himself.

When you read a piece of copy, you should practice “active reading.” Passive reading is what the majority of people do when they read. The passive reader just absorbs the material and questions nothing within. Your task as an active reader is to tease out subtext and try to infer the writer’s purpose behind what was written

It’s not good enough to simply read a piece of copy every day. You must practice active reading. That is, you read with purpose. You’ll read with pen in hand, discovering and marking patterns that will make writing your own copy much, much easier...

New New is the single most important emotion to drive a successful piece of copy. People are highly skeptical of advertising and they have very short attention spans. The most direct way to combat their fickle attention is to put something “new and novel” in front of them. It must be something they’ve truly never seen before

To frame how important “New” is… Just remember this phrase: “categorization is DEATH.” If the reader ever feels they can label your message as something they’ve “seen before…” Or even label your message as SIMILAR to something they’ve seen before… i.e. They think: “This is just like that thing I saw yesterday…” Then you and your copy are DEAD.

Finally, the solution to their problems. Something new = hope. So the emotion of New isn’t just about holding attention to learn what the new thing is. Many beginner copywriters believe intrigue alone will propel readers to continue reading. But that’s not New’s true purpose. New isn’t just a set of “power words.” Even though New does hold attention, and New does have power… It’s power comes from one thing NOBODY talks about… New offers “hope.” Hope that finally, the one thing that they have been searching for is in front of them

New’s Alter Ego is “Only” Only is a very simple emotion to grasp… You can “Only get this solution here, through me, on this page.” To say you can only get something on this page means… “If you haven’t bought this before on this page, then you haven’t bought anything like this before.” To say you can only get something through me, means it is unique and proprietary to me. So the subtext is, “if I didn’t sell you this thing, you haven’t bought anything like this before.” These ideas convey the same sentiment as “New.” Which, again, is: “this is different.” But more powerfully. Only amplifies New. New is Peter Parker and Only is Spider-Man

Insecure You see, like the New emotion, there is a chance that your prospect has tried something similar to what you’re offering now… And it failed them. Maybe they blamed the products they bought. But maybe, at a deeper level, they blamed themselves. “I’m not smart enough.” “I’m not rich enough.” “I’m too ugly, too short, too fat, too bald, too oily, too weak…” So a writer can multiply the effect of Easy by making things easy enough that Anybody can do it. And that is where Easy’s alter ego comes in

A Hidden Benefit of Safe Employing the Safe emotion will combat reader skepticism… And it will also make your offer more appear more VALUABLE to your reader. Psychology studies have shown that when people consider something “risky,” they also judge that thing’s benefits as less valuable.

This might feel counterintuitive to the real world, where higher risk usually comes tied to higher potential rewards, but copywriters are not selling to logical beings… They are selling to people. So knowing what we know about irrational people, the Safe emotion serves two goals: 1. It makes the reader less skeptical about your offer, thereby making the reader more open to the idea of buying 2. By reducing risk, Safe automatically increases the reader’s perceived value of your offer, because studies have shown that things people perceive as “less risky” are perceived as “more valuable

What does this mean for you, as a copywriter? It means your reader is very much invested in eliminating as much risk as possible. Remember when we said the Safe emotion increases PERCEIVED value of your offer? Here’s your proof… Given two valuable options, people would prefer the LESS VALUABLE option ($80 instead of $100)… As long as it is LESS RISKY (100% vs 80% chance). They perceive the more Safe option as more desirable, even though it is in fact, less valuable. Just to feel that sense of Safe

Safe’s Alter Ego is “Predictable.” There’s a powerful way to jack up the level of Safe a reader feels. If a copywriter can convey that something follows a Predictable pattern… That the opportunity follows in-step with something similar that has happened before… Or that this opportunity or its benefits are “inevitable,” then readers will perceive that thing as even more “Safe.” Showing patterns inside credibility, track record, testimonials, case studies, success stories, etc., demonstrates that “xyz result” is more “Predictable.

How Predictable is this benefit? 93%. This is a great time to explain why the writer would not WANT to claim 100% certainty… A 100% claim in the stock market is simply unbelievable. The entire world would be turned upside down if one person could figure out how to never miss a single opportunity in the stock market. Everybody in the world would be breaking down doors to get that solution and its value would clearly be infinity dollars, since you could never lose money. Therefore, a 100% certainty claim would actually create more skepticism, not less. It’s up to you to draw that line in your copy, depending on your niche and product offering

It’s growing even faster than Amazon. And we know these companies all made a lot of people overnight millionaires.

In order to just make two times your money, that sucker would have to go up ONE THOUSAND dollars more! That could take around, oh let’s see… an entire century. But if you had been among the lucky few investors who moved fast, before Amazon went public… You’d be set for life. Taking orders from nobody.

The Four Sections of Copy All words in a piece of copy are not created equal. Remember that the Big 4 should be weaved into virtually every line of copy… And aside from those emotions, specific words have specific roles to play, depending on what section of the copy they are in. There is an order to a sales letter, and that is important. Abandon the order, and the copy doesn’t make as much sense. So think of it like this… In English we say: “The red apple.” In Spanish it’s reversed; “La manzana roja.” Translated literally: “The apple red.” If you screw around with the order, the meaning isn’t totally lost… But it sure is mangled. And that is bad for keeping the attention of busy and skeptical readers. So to simplify everything, let’s break the copy into four sections… And we will have specific things to look for in each section while we are actively reading… The four sections of copy are: 1. The headline 2. The lead 3. The body 4. The offer

Ultra-Specific The next U is Ultra-specific. Find some way to make the opportunity “weirdly” specific. Don’t tell someone they can make $10,000. Tell them they can make $10,251 (odd numbers supposedly work best). Don’t tell them they’ll look 10 years younger… Tell them they’ll look 12 and a half years younger. Starting to get it? Don’t tell them their strength will improve 100%... Tell them it will improve 251%. Alright. So that’s one way. Another way to plug in some ultra-specificity is with speed. Selling a karate course? “A 3-second karate move that can take out someone 134 pounds heavier than you!” The specific numbers imply that the headline’s claim has been tested and proven before

To convey something unique, just pull one item from your product or offer, and emphasize it. The Money Zone product doesn’t trade traditional stocks. The Night Trader product trades at night. It’s not rocket science. Your product probably has more than one unique element to it. For instance, here is a second headline for The Hottest IPO that I wrote… This headline is selling the same product as The Hottest IPO, but with a completely fresh and unique idea. The main selling point of The Hottest IPO and The $15 Trillion Gadget is that self-driving cars are going to be very disruptive. So I was able to tie that idea of self-driving cars to an IPO and also tie it to the physical parts that make self-driving cars work. This is useful for refreshing fatiguing copy, but that’s a little advanced for this section. The point is… finding something unique in your offer or product just requires a little critical thinking

Finding something unique isn’t that hard. In fact, that is probably the hardest part… There is no “right answer” for you. It probably won’t “jump out at you.” Because your unique element could be any insignificant thing. There just needs to be a unique element in your headline that the reader has never, ever seen before. An easy “hack” to think about this: “The first BLANK to ever…” “The first skin cream to ever use volcanic ash.” “The first options trading system to ever exclusively trade 25 cent options…” This conveys New, and New conveys unique

When we wrote this promo, cryptocurrencies were hot. Everybody was piling into crypto. So how could I make headline about cryptocurrencies feel unique? I could just pick one element about the crypto and highlight it. All I had to do was draw attention to how cheap the crypto was and voila. I wouldn’t say, “The first crypto ever to be 70 cents and could make you rich.” That’s why templates are bad news. Once you can speak the copywriting language, your headline will use words that are as natural to you as how you describe your favorite restaurant. Think about this… If you wanted to convince me to go to your favorite restaurant, you probably wouldn’t say: “How do I get Kyle interested in this restaurant? Ummm… It’s the first restaurant ever to… Uhhh… the first restaurant ever to give me two loaves of bread before dinner?” If you try to fit your writing into a tight template, it will stifle your abilities...

Intrigue Alone is NOT Useful – What’s In It For Me? (WIIFM) I have seen experienced copywriters make this mistake before... They’ll show me a headline and say, “What do you think?” I search and search but then I’m forced to ask, “What’s in it for me?” And then they’ll say something like, “Well, this is a topic they should really be interested in reading more about...” Then they frown and realize that intrigue alone is not going to cut it. Sometimes even great writers can get caught up in the excitement of their idea. But great copywriters also know that intrigue alone is not enough to pull a reader into your sales letter. Once this error is pointed out to them, experienced copywriters immediately go back to the drawing board without argument. Remember, everyone wants to know “What’s In It For Me?” That’s why “WIIFM is everyone’s favorite radio station.” Your headline must be useful to the reader

the researcher has to communicate pretty much all the major details of the study. That could be the major details about the sample, the methods, and the results. And that serves as a high-level summary of the what you can expect if you purchase the research article… If a reader wants the finer details, they buy or read the whole article. That’s basically what a copywriter is tasked to do when writing a lead. Here are the FIVE major things you’ll want to accomplish in a lead:  Capture attention (Can be done in headline)  Expand upon the headline  Establish credibility  Make a big promise  Open a loop (

A Lead Should Contain The Most Compelling Claims and Info That Will Be Covered In The Copy A copywriter has to cram some of the “major” information about what will be covered in the body copy into the first couple pages… Or approximately 500-ish words. Keep in mind, leads can vary in length. In long form sales letters, I’ve seen leads range anywhere from 2-7 pages

The Lead Should Introduce the Fundamental Claim or Idea That Will Be Covered or Proven in the Body Copy. That does NOT mean you must reveal the offer or product in the lead. Not even a little bit. In many sales letters, the offer or product is hidden until the very last few pages. Usually in a long form sales letter, the lead’s purpose is to build hype about an opportunity… Or really illustrate the terrible problem that needs to be solved. It does that by acutely focusing on the Big 4, right up until the “guru” is introduced. Often, once the “guru” behind the letter (the guy selling something) is introduced, the lead is over. And essentially, by the time you reach the end of the lead, all the major information that would make your prospect want to buy should have already been conveyed. The rest of the letter, called the body copy, is just “proving the point.” A Lead Offers ONE Big Idea or Promise Which Can Be Summed Up In A Single Sentence

In my experience, writing a lead is an “ongoing” process. That is, I won’t actually know everything that will be in the lead until the promo is about fully written. Sometimes when I’m writing the body copy I’ll discover some neat hook, a weird angle, or a new piece of information I could go back and inject into the lead

The Headline, Lead, and Body Copy Share a “Soul.” Before you write a word of copy, summarize your idea in one sentence. This is the “soul” of your letter. It is the lifeforce that compelled you to write your piece of copy in the first place. The reason for this is you NEED a single coherent direction. Start with this question: what is the one major benefit or payoff that everything in your copy will tie to? I’ve heard this called “The Golden Thread.” And it’s also been referred to as “The Rule of One.” I call it the “Soul.” Ideally, you’ll know exactly what the Soul of your copy is before you start writing. But as I mentioned earlier, for me writing the lead is an “ongoing process.” That’s why I like the term “Soul.” It gives your idea permission to exist like a living thing… Something that grows and evolves over time. Sometimes your Soul will be crystal clear… Sometimes you will have to hash out a couple attempts to focus or find your Soul. But you should always have some sense for what your Soul is about. New information should just sharpen the Soul and make it clearer

But at the end of writing your copy, EVERYTHING should be tied to ONE idea that you can sum up in a single sentence. For example, I wrote a promo called Trump Bonus Checks with another copywriter, Rob Braddock. We had ONE sentence to guide all of our writing.

You should have made a big promise in your headline… Your promise is weird and specific enough to capture and hold attention… It offers something the reader wants… And chances are, the reader is so cynical and skeptical they are on the edge of shouting “bullshit” the first chance they get. In fact, they can’t wait to call bullshit on a “scammy marketer” like you. They live for it! This is the time to inject some cred that proves either: 1. You are a credible authority, who should be listened to, or… 2. Your claims are supported by credible authorities You do not need to make a big show of credibility in the lead.

The writer may want to lean more heavily on introducing and proving claims about how Fast the system pays out benefits and how Anybody can use it. The Big Promise should reflect that as well.

The Lead Should Open A Loop At this point in the lead, the writer has brought up their big promise and presented their most compelling claims… Now they need to create an “open loop.” An open loop is just a “tease” for information that will be revealed later in the letter. This is also referred to as a “bribe.” (I got the term “bribe” from Clayton Makepeace). It’s a bribe you offer them in exchange for them to continue reading. Luckily, opening a loop is pretty simple to execute, and can be written like: “In just a second, I will show you exactly how ‘the claims I just said’ are totally true.” This is a simple open loop… You’ll see variants as you binge copy… Another common example: “If you stick with me, I will prove beyond a shadow of a doubt how you can ‘receive the benefits I promised.

When you look at leads the way I have described, the job becomes fairly straightforward. The copywriter should already understand the Soul of his project. He has summed up his idea in a single sentence. i.e. for Trump Bonus Checks we used “Trump did a thing, now you get paid.” Then the copywriter is tasked with proving that idea. The writers task is to find information that proves the claims… Then communicate them through the Big 4 Emotions. Once you see that, and truly grasp it in your bones… Writing copy just becomes a system of answering simple questions. Start with: The soul of my Soul promo summed up in a single sentence is… Then: “How do I prove this is Big? What can I compare it to that was Big already?” “How can I demonstrate to the reader how Easy and Fast this is?” The best writers in the world know this… Even though it’s quite possible they don’t consciously know that they are doing it this way. Because they think they just “get it.” They speak the language of copywriting. Just like when you talk to your friends… You don’t consciously realize when you are conjugating verbs or using adjectives to modify nouns. You just do it

Multiple” = more than one chance to profit = Safe.  “Triple digit wins” = Big wins.  “542%” is specific enough to imply some intense calculation has been run to produce this number = Safe.  That 542% number is a pretty nice return = Big.  “Coming months” = Predictable

The Body Template The body copy will consist almost entirely of a copywriter repeating this single template over and over. Like most elements of the copywriting language, you would probably never even notice that a sales letter is just repeating this over and over unless you were specifically trained to translate copy. Good thing you have this guide, huh? Again, I want to repeat that this is one of the few instances where I say it is a good idea for you to stick to the template almost always.

copywriter may blatantly address the objection in their copy this way: “I bet by now you are probably wondering, “how much money can I make?’” Or the copywriter can cut that step and just jump straight to the next step of the template: Claim. Before I dive into claims, I’ll just rattle off some of the most common objections you might spot while translating copy…  Why shouldn’t I just use an alternative?  Why should I act now?  Who are you?  Why should I listen to you?  How did you figure this out?  How does it work?  Why are you telling me about this?  Is this going to be difficult?  What do I need to get started?  Will this take a lot of time?  Is this risky?  How much will the results improve my life? / How big are the “results?” / How much money can I make, etc.  How fast will it take to see results?  How much does it cost?  What if it doesn’t work?

Making a Claim It’s very easy and subtler for a copywriter to anticipate an objection… And then start a new section of copy with they state a direct claim that answers the “unspoken” objection. The un-stated objection: How much money can I make? The copywriter turns the answer (a claim) into a subhead: “You can make $10,000 in a week with this system.” Okay, that’s a cool. The copywriter has made their claim. And he didn’t need to directly state the objection (How much money can I make?) in the copy at all. Now it’s time for the proof. Presenting Proof Proof is any information that can help the copywriter substantiate their claim

Generally, proof comes in threes. That’s pretty important. The writing can feel a little “unresolved” if the writer only offers one or two pieces of proof. More than three is great… But generally, three is the magic number of proof points.

at this stage of the template the copywriter has claimed the reader can make $10,000 with their system. But they cannot find three pieces of proof showing $10,000 returns. The $10,000 mark is just too high. That’s okay. There’s a simple trick for this. Here’s what they’d do.

Generally, proof comes in threes. That’s pretty important. The writing can feel a little “unresolved” if the writer only offers one or two pieces of proof. More than three is great… But generally, three is the magic number of proof points. Let’s go over the most common types of proof.  Case studies  Demonstrations  Testimonials  Quotes from authorities  Charts and graphs  Official documents  Articles and headlines So at this stage of the template the copywriter has claimed the reader can make $10,000 with their system. But they cannot find three pieces of proof showing $10,000 returns. The $10,000 mark is just too high. That’s okay. There’s a simple trick for this. Here’s what they’d do. Proof #1: “Look at what happened when my proprietary system said buy Stock ABC… *show a chart of Stock ABC* You could have made $5,000!” Proof #2: “And then the system said buy Stock DEF… *show a chart of Stock DEF* You could have made $7,500!” Proof

Show Don’t Tell When a copywriter is offering up their three or more pieces of proof, they would like “show” instead of “tell” as often as possible. You can try to present number gains as visuals, like the charts in the above example. Generally with each of the three pieces of proof, you’ll want to re-present them two to three times in different ways. This is called a “reframe.

Reframing The Proof So in the above example, the copywriter provided a visual chart AND told the reader about the monetary gains. That’s two presentations. How else could the copywriter “show” the reader how much money they were getting? A good copywriter will try reframe proof often. Continuing the previous example… “You could have made a whopping $10,000! Use my proprietary system to collect that much every month and you are clearing six-figures in yearly income!” That’s a reframe. I changed the frame from a one-time $10,000 win into a “yearly income.” It’s not difficult, see

All you need to do for a reframe is present a new perspective on the same information. Another easy way for a copywriter to reframe their proof is just to make a simple, relatable comparison. Let’s try another. “You could have made a whopping $10,000! That’s 765 times more money that what you would have made sticking your money in the S&P 500 for the entire year!” When a copywriter reframes their proof, they are making the proof “three-dimensional.” In a reader’s mind, it becomes more tangible. More real

Showing the Reader The Benefit Everyone always says, talk about benefits over features. Finally, here’s a copywriter’s big chance. Step 1: They’ve anticipated the objection… Step 2: They’ve stated a claim that combats the objection… Step 3: They’ve presented three pieces of proof that support the claim AND reframed each to make them three-dimensional… Now it’s time to talk benefits. Here’s how you’d do it: Continuing our example after our third piece of proof… “You could have made a whopping $10,000! Make that much every month with this system and you are clearing six-figures in yearly income! Won’t you be the talk of the town? Imagine it… People will whisper about you, ‘how did he afford that fancy new car?’ ‘Did you see his new pool?’ ‘What about that trip to Italy he took his family on!

A Dark Tip About Benefits Let me share something with you that I have found to be universally true. Things that people consider the most personal, are actually the most common. That is, everyone’s personal shame is EVERYONE’S personal shame. Are you jealous of your successful, beautiful best friend who has had it so easy their whole life? So is everyone else. Do you resent how you allowed yourself to be manipulated in your last relationship… or all your relationships? So does everyone else

Single One-Time Move That Can Produce the Equivalent of $1,846 Every Week This one secret move could not only supplement your retirement, but could bring in more money than your salary alone. I’m sure George was a little scared of trying something new... Something outside the stock market, bonds, typical real estate or anything you might have heard before. “At first I was really skeptical. I didn’t believe it.” But thanks to this little-known, one-time move… George was able to immediately gross $96,000 in yearly income for himself and his family. While I haven't had a chance to personally vet his financials…

Just imagine pocketing the equivalent of $1,846… every single week… for LIFE. More money than most people collect from an entire month of Social Security. And George says he only spends about an hour a week checking in on his income! Which is about “eight to nine thousand,” he whispered in amazement. Now George has a reliable way to keep making a lot of money in retirement… George says his own family has a hard time believing his rapid success. Because most folks have never heard of such a lucrative strategy as this. The objection is: Will this be hard? My claim is: “A Single One-Time Move That Can Produce the Equivalent of $1,846 Every Week.” My proof is George’s story. He’s a regular, skeptical guy who executed a little-known, one-time move to collect $96,000 in yearly income. I asked the reader to imagine the benefits of $1,846 every single week for life. I reframed the amount by comparing it to social security. I also make sure to cover the Big 4 Emotions… Inside my story I suggest George was trying something NEW. I insist most people don’t know this secret. ONLY (New’s alter ego) I do. I tell the reader it is only a one-time move. It doesn’t require a ton of work. It’s EASY. I address the reader’s skepticism through George and his own shock. Ensuring it is SAFE and ANYBODY (Easy’s alter ego) can do it. George’s checks come in “eight to nine thousand” a month. PREDICTABLE (Safe’s alter ego) income. And for a one-time move, eight to nine thousand a month is pretty damn BIG and FAST. Rinse and repeat for the next section of the body copy. Just remember to check off as many of the Big 4 boxes as possible. The reader will be convinced.

The “Better Than” section simultaneously builds the hype for your opportunity… Which makes it perfect for around the lead… While also selling the reader OUT of doing the “popular thing” of the moment. Selling out of something basically means selling “away” from something… It’s the process of selling someone on NOT doing something else.

WARNING: Do Not Read This Unless You Are Already Rich! If you would like to know how someone can start with a simple idea... and then... generate over $51,000,000 in sales in just one year... this is going to be the most interesting message you will ever read. Here is why: There's a guy in California named Carl Palmer who, until recently, was very wealthy and very bored. He got rich (the first time) by starting a company in 1970 which he sold out to Coca-Cola just three years later in 1973. As part of the deal, he had to sign a "non-compete" agreement with a duration of five years. After that five years ended, he went back in business and built up another company which was soon acquired by the giant AMF Corporation. After that, Carl developed Shackley's reverse osmosis home water filtration system... and... in the first year... they did $51 million in sales with that product. And so on. You get the idea. What this guy does is, he comes up with enormously valuable inventions, starts a company to sell those inventions... and soon... he goes nuts with all the hassles of running a business... and so... he sells out (at a huge profit) to some giant corporation that has the resources and the clout to exploit the living daylights out of whatever it is he has invented. But now, he has outdone himself. Now, at the request of the Seychelle Technologies, Inc., he has invented something that is needed by every human being in the world... and... This Invention Is Almost Certain To Generate Billions In Sales! Pay attention to how Halbert explains the pattern between “You get the idea” and “But now, he has outdone himself.

The Guru/Credibility Section The Guru or “Credibility” section is pretty much ubiquitous in all pieces of copy… It’s also where I draw a hard, black and white line for transition from the “lead” to “body copy.” When you see the credibility section, you are officially in the body copy. The credibility section is designed to overcome the “who are you?” and “why should I listen to you?” objections. So while you are binging and translating copywriting you’ll notice the credibility section communicates: “You should listen to me.” That is the copywriter’s claim: “You should listen to me.” Generally, the copywriter will introduce the guru and then list some reasons the guru is credible. That can include photos with prominent, credible people… A list of appearances on authority sources, like being on TV and news networks… Or a track record of success or accurate predictions. Usually, you won’t see case studies or testimonials at this point. Those are mostly reserved for the Offer Copy, which we will cover in a little bit

It addresses the objection: “how do you know about this?” And usually communicates some element of New’s alter ego, “Only.” That is, the story could be about a key piece of information gathered from a secret source… Or some elite network… The proof would simply be offering proof such a relationship exists between the guru and the secret source. Made Up Example: Here’s a made up example off the top of my head, and we will build on this in the coming sections… “As you know, I have worked on government projects before. And on one of these projects I overheard a secret meeting. Afterward, I approached one of the men and asked him about it, and what he shared with me blew my mind. I can’t tell you all the details here… All you need to know is this is the most explosive opportunity I’ve ever come across.

Continuing the Made-Up Example: Let’s expand upon our made-up secret government opportunity from earlier… “The mysterious man told me about a secret government contract with major chip manufacturers around the world that would set up a $250 billion industry.” How can you make the reader believe this is true? The writer can back this big claim up with proof using “signs” of things to come. The writing is on the wall so to speak. (Safe/Predictable) A writer may say something like… “Even though everyone has been kept hush hush, several prominent chip companies have quietly enjoyed explosion in their stocks recently. That’s because the insiders know what’s happening and they’re pouring in money now.

Another challenge in this promo was convincing the reader that Bitcoin was on its way out, and our coin was the better coin. Here’s the key insight we used to prove that point:

Basically, The Layman’s Explanation is where you’ll explain how the opportunity functions… And do so in a way that two people half-drunk at the bar would be able to explain it to each other. This is a cousin of the key insight. Remember the Big 4 emotions when creating The Layman’s Explanation. So, picture two people hunched over at the bar. Their faces are red and their eyes are half-closed from drinking too much. Person 1 says to Person 2, “That’s a bunch of bullshit. You’ll believe anything you read online.” What Person 2 says in reply IS the Layman’s Explanation section. If it’s a system you’re selling, the drunkard will reply with something like… “Nooo. Look, it’s simple. You just follow these three steps and BAM. Success. Listen, the secret is the “patented technology.” I’ve never seen anything like it. It’s this new thing scientists discovered that makes the whole thing work. I thought the same thing you’re thinking now. Until I heard about that “patented technology.” I’m telling you... This is the real deal.

If it is our government contract example I just made up above, Person 2’s reply would be something like: “Nooo. Look, it’s simple. Ya know how the government spends billions of dollars every year on war? Well now there’s a NEW sector and it’s WAY cheaper than the old way... So the government is going all in RIGHT NOW! I’ve never seen anything like it. They got these computers now that can do 500 times what the old technology did and at a fraction of the cost! I thought the same thing you’re thinking now.

The Technical Explanation The Technical Explanation is just the Layman’s Explanation dressed up in a lab coat with glasses. If it were a system I were selling, I would go into crazy detail about the science behind the “patented technology.” So much detail as to fly over the head of the reader. And that is by design. For instance, I could present the complicated scientific formula that makes it all work. This communicates, “I’m smarter than you. Trust me.” For the made-up government contracts example we have above, I could talk about computer chips in more detail. I could mention the microns and nanosecond reaction times or something

The copywriter is throwing so much jargon and technical stuff at the reader so they will think to themselves, “Okay, okay, I don’t understand any of this stuff. I’m not a computer genius.

Section 4: The Offer Hooray, we’ve made it to the offer! It’s all downhill from here… sort of. Generally, the offer section in long form direct response copy occupies the last twenty to thirty percent of the text. It’s very similar to the format of any “free webinar” you might have attended. You get about 45 minutes of content… Followed by a 15-minute pitch… And sometimes, if the webinar host is feeling generous, you get about 30-40 minutes Q&A. Frankly, it’s no different in copywriting… Because webinars are based on high performing sales techniques and often scripted by copywriters

What To Look For In An Offer A ton of information must be conveyed quickly and directly in an offer… This is the part of your copy where you will be asking a reader to whip out their credit card, so you want to make sure they have NO reason not to… That means being crystal clear with details and instructions for them to follow. Here are the most common elements that make up the offer section:  Summarize everything discussed so far  Intro report  Intro service o The unique selling proposition o How it works / What to expect / What you get o Pump in some cred  Add bonuses  Share testimonials  Recap  Offer guarantee  Limit the Spots or Quantity  Set a deadline  Ask for sale These do not have to be presented in a specific order

A Membership or Subscription Service Is One of the Most Complicated Offers The reason membership and subscription offers are so complicated is because the SELLER is usually selling a subscription… While the BUYER is usually interested in buying into the “opportunity” or “system” that has been teased throughout the copy. As such, the offer section will require an introduction of both the “report” that explains the opportunity… And then must also introduce the subscription service itself

Guess what? Report X is free. Here are the details inside: x… y… and z… i.e. “Inside you’ll learn: Exactly how to profit, what ticker symbol to invest in, and my sophisticated, full research.” The report will reveal everything the reader desperately wants to know that was only teased in the sales letter. But the objective of the copywriter is to get a new subscriber… So they might write something like: “But in order to receive the free report, you must subscribe to my newsletter or membership service, ‘The ABC Club’ for $49 per year.

Get it now? I’m actually selling the subscription service. That just adds a slight wrinkle to information you must convey in the offer. But it’s no big deal. You can use a similar setup for anything else you’re selling. If I’m selling basketball training… I could write an entire sales letter about, “The one secret to being a better basketball player than Lebron James.” I could talk about that one secret the whole time. I could illustrate how it is New, Safe, Easy, and Big. Then say, “I’ll give you the secret when you join my basketball training club.” Until the offer section, the reader may have never known there was a club! And that’s okay. It’s up to you what items you select to highlight in your copy... You may want to test a couple angles and find the best performing one, then ditch the others. Here’s an example of introducing the report and subscription service from The 70 Cent Crypto

It’s not what you say, it’s what you communicate. You’ll be happy to know, there are still only 4 main things you’ll want to keep top of mind when writing an offer:  New/Only  Easy/Anybody  Safe/Predictable  Big/Fast So when you’re reading an offer by a master copywriter, see if you can recognize examples of them weaving the Big 4 (and their alter-egos) into the information to make it more exciting

Summarize Everything Discussed Before In the lesson on body copy, you learned that body copy follows a typical structure of: Objection, Claim, Proof, Benefit format. Once one claim is proven and the benefits presented, there is an opportunity for the copywriter to weave in a quick reminder about the opportunity before moving on and presenting a new claim in the next section. That’s why the following part of the offer copy should stick out like a sore thumb… You’ll notice you are about 70 percent through the copy and it seems like you’re re-reading the lead all over again. No new information is being presented… No new claim is being proven… At this point your brain will see the pattern: You know you are reaching the offer copy. In a moment, the writer will present you with the opportunity to “get in” on what he’s been hyping up, via some product offer or report. So in order to get you in the state of mind to badly want that thing (usually a report)… He is going to use the same hype from the lead to get you hype again. This part will be similar to the lead. Sometimes instead of presenting claims, the writer will suggest he has fulfilled all their claims from earlier. Like this: “You’ve seen the proof that X Claim is happening… I’ve shown you the proof about Y Claim. And now you can get the details in X Report

Intro Report See how easily that flowed? We recapped, rebuilt the hype that caused you to read in the first place, then presented you with an opportunity to “get in.” You’ll also notice, we REALLY jack up the urgency as we get closer and closer to the close of the letter. More on urgency in a moment. When you see a copywriter intro the report, you’ll notice the copywriter doesn’t give away the specifics inside. Instead, they tell you about the information you, the reader, hope to get from inside. “Once you have this report, it will only take you 5 minutes and 3 clicks of your mouse to get in front of this life-changing opportunity!

Notice that in this made-up example, I don’t go into boring details inside the report. Instead, I stick to my core emotions, the Big 4 Emotions. This particular line, I highlight how easy, fast, and big this all is. And the fact that they don’t know the information in my report and I am holding it, triggers New/Only. Bam. All four hit. And I didn’t give away anything. Not only is withholding the details MORE effective… Divulging the details is INEFFECTIVE and actually HARMFUL. There’s two reasons for that. 1. Information is not sexy 2. The reader may believe they have this “figured out.

The human brain cannot deal with raw data. Sure, it can solve problems and calculate things… But it cannot come to an emotional or motivated conclusion based on facts.

If you activate their calculating, analytical part of the brain, even for a moment, that kills all the momentum you’ve built. In fact, make sure that you are mostly presenting stories in your body copy too. Never just use raw data as proof. As for the second point: the reader cannot be allowed to think they have your secret “figured out.” The moment they think, “Oh I think I know what this secret is… I can do this on my own…” Then they are gone. They’ll either try to do it on their own… Or they will try and find another version of your secret for cheaper, if they think they know what your thing is. You must never allow your opportunity to be categorized as a commodity. If that happens, it’s over. On that note: You can keep your report from being “another boring old report” by calling it something else. Anything else! Dossier, Bulletin, Hot Sheet, Guide, Manual. These are just a few quick examples. You’ll notice we called the report in The 70 Cent Crypto a “dossier.” And we called the Pre-IPO Prospectus a “prospectus.” But I’m not here to tell you what to write. That would not serve you. Writing copy is not a “how to.” Instead, you must binge on copy, translate out the subtext, and then you’ll know what to look for when you see another writer Intro the Report in their offer section. After seeing a couple examples, you’ll quickly come up with New, unique names for your own report with a little bit of thought. You’ll see ways to weave New, Safe, Easy, and Big into your report tease.

Intro The Service This is the real offer you want to the reader to take… A quick note about the “trial offer” line… “I’d like to rush this report to you in the next 5 minutes totally free… As part of a trial offer for my research service, Service ABC.” Usually the words trial offer only appear in front end products, where the price is $49 and they can get their money back if unsatisfied. The words “trial offer” doesn’t usually appear in back end offers… Because back end offers are priced at $2,000 and above… And you don’t want the customer to buy, steal the information in the report, and then ask for a refund. So most folks do not offer a “trial offer” for back ends. Many folks do not offer refunds for back ends at all. You’ve seen examples of how a writer might introduce the report and then the service… And you’ll pick up more as you binge copy. So now what? Now it’s time to sell the service itself.

may be the only service that uses the special system you’ve been teasing. Or the only service that does things the special way they do… Or has the special people involved that are involved.

Your USP doesn’t even have to be THAT “unique.” Sounds like I’m contradicting myself now, huh? So there are three ways to create a USP

Actually Unique You can use something truly unique, like a proprietary formula or patented technology or process… Label Something Common as Unique Or you can highlight something COMMON about your product that nobody else has highlighted before. A classic example comes from a company that was having trouble selling fire alarms. They brought on a copywriter who asked how the alarms were made. After going over how the alarms were made, the copywriter said, “These connectors are gold plated. We should sell that.” The manufacturer said, “all company’s connectors are gold plated.” The copywriter said, “but nobody is talking about it!” I got that story from Joseph Sugarman’s Adweek Copywriting Handbook, I believe. Give Something “Old” A New Name The South Beach diet failed in its first several iterations because it was named “The modified carbohydrate diet.” That was not new and not sexy. So they called the same old thing something new, “The South Beach Diet” and bam, national success. One more example… The iPod was not an original idea. There were TONS of MP3 players all over the market, made by a zillion manufacturers. But Steve Jobs in his infinite wisdom decided to market the iPod as “1,000 songs in your pocket.

How it Works / What to Expect / What You Get The next thing you have to do once you have told the reader why your product is unique, is tell them what to expect from their experience. You’ll notice copywriters make it as clear as possible, answering questions like: What comes with this service or membership? How often will I receive an email? What will be in the emails?

That way the reader can see it, and it will help them recognize the format, the branding, and most importantly… What to expect! This is also a great time to include anything else that comes standard with the offer. That could be special access to an exclusive website, a customer service number, or any other regular emails they might receive. Because your competitors will probably be offering similar things, you will want to “dress” your standard offering “up.” You’ll see it in the copy while you’re binging. Call your report something weird. Call your website something weird. Instead of just saying, “here’s our customer service phone number,” say something like, “We have a dedicated team of specialists to support you for this project. Here’s their number.” No matter where you are in the copy, every element should feel New. When you are in the offer section, it is really tempting to just say, “this is what you want, here it is…” and just give them the information. But you have to fight against that urge. Even in the offer section, you should make every effort to keep the reader from thinking, “Oh, I’ve seen this before.” And while making your offer, remember, specifics are key. And in the specifics, you want to emphasize how EASY you’ve made everything. “You’ll receive an email from me every Monday morning when the markets open. Inside I’ll include commentary about the markets, one trade recommendation, and step by step instructions to execute that trade if you wish to invest. Everything you need to get in the trade is right there in the email, and you can be in any of these trades in mere minutes. You don’t need a special brokerage account, any old one will do... You don’t need a specific amount of money, either. In fact, anybody can follow these simple instructions with just an internet connection and 10 minutes of time.” I just made all that up

will give investors a ton of money overnight. So I could offer a bonus report about another profitable investing sector where the government has big, profitable contracts. Or I could offer a bonus report about other investing sectors that will benefit from the computer chips themselves. Or I could send them some sort of physical product… Like a free laptop that contains the very computer chip the company makes! Generally, you should make your bonuses related to your big opportunity. In my personal opinion, tacking on random unrelated bonuses subtracts from the strength of your original offer. You wouldn’t want to tack a “how to buy gold” bonus at the end of your cryptocurrency letter. (These two are basically at polar opposite ends of the investing ideology pole) That’s probably the only rule I would put on bonuses. You might think, “Why would anybody do that?” The quick answer is: because it’s easy. Sometimes people have leftover bonuses or free software they can bundle and throw in with their offer. So they just bundle a bunch of random stuff and throw it at the reader. Again, to me, that just cheapens your original pitch. That’s my two cents. Just try to get creative when you can. There is a lack of creativity in this world. Keep your eyes peeled for creative bonuses while you’re binging copy

quick and easy way to mimic your reader is by using photos, even stock photos will do, of people who should resemble your ideal reader. If you are writing mostly for old white men, find some images of old white men to plug in beside the testimonials. If you are writing for young female yoga enthusiasts, find some images of young ladies performing yoga. For all graphics, if you didn’t PAY for them - make sure to only use royalty free images and/or images labeled for commercial use. Basically, don’t grab random images off Google. That’s an easy way to get in trouble. The best testimonials include the most specifics. Example 1: “This service is great!” That’s a pretty cool testimonial. But let’s look at one (made up example) with more specifics… Example 2: “I had $65 to my name. I spent $49 on Guru A’s service. My mom, who I was living with, thought I was crazy. I memorized everything in Guru A’s book and employed every step in chapters 2-4, verbatim. Two weeks later I was a millionaire. Thank god for Guru A. They changed my life.” The more details in the testimonial, the greater chance for the Big 4 to be weaved into them. From this example above we can see that the opportunity to follow Guru A is Big, Fast, Easy, Safe, and Anybody could do it. So if you have testimonials, look at the long ones.

Gathering Testimonials If you don’t have a list of testimonials ready to go, that’s okay too. First, think of the perfect story you’d want to hear in your testimonial, then ask 3-5 open-ended questions that guide your reader to tell that story. If you want them to say something like: “I made a ton of money thanks to Guru A in just a couple weeks! I invested in stock xyz as soon as they said to and boom! I made $6,000! I highly recommend Guru A’s service!” That’s a stellar testimonial To get a response like that, you might ask these basic, guided questions:  Did you make a lot of money thanks to Guru A?  How much money and how fast did you do it?  How did you do it?  Would you recommend Guru A’s service? Remember, Safe is our big emotion with testimonials… So the more specifics you include, the more you talk about how the reader followed the guru’s instructions and won, the more real and safe the testimonial will feel. When you are binging copywriting and come to the testimonials section, you can translate the testimonials into useful questions that you can use yourself

Before we talk about what to say, let’s talk about what you’re communicating. You’re communicating that this offer contains an intense amount of value. It’s BIG

An easy way to execute this is with a price anchor. Before we get to the price anchor, let’s look at some recap sections… Here’s how we did it for a front end product: The Hottest IPO. Notice how we bullet out each piece of our offer and tease a little bit of information…

The Price Anchor The price anchor is just the psychological starting point for how much an offer is “really worth.” Like a negotiation, the higher you can drive this number up at the start, the better. This is really easy to do in a bullet driven recap like we did in The Hottest IPO… Cover all the things that come standard with the offer. Give each piece its own bullet with a little bit of detail added. In as few words as possible, explain what they can expect and how simple it all is… Cover all the bonuses offered, and tease some of the information inside. And here’s the little trick: Beside each bullet, assign a value. “My exclusive Pre-IPO Prospectus…: ($199 Value)”. When you reach the end of your bullets, you can sum up all of your stuff and say something like, “Wow, that’s an $8,414 value!” That creates what is known as a price anchor. Then you can say, “but you won’t pay anywhere near that today… In fact, you won’t even pay HALF that. You can have all this incredible value, $8,414 worth, for just $49.”

You may have gotten the sense that $8,414 for just $49 is a little bit of… well, bullshit. That’s over a 99% reduction. Nobody would ever deliver that much value so cheap. And that’s a common reaction. Instead of just telling you that earlier, I thought I’d show you first… There is a rule of thumb for your price anchor

But it will be a lot easier for the reader to accept that your offer of $421 has been reduced down to $49… Than an offer worth $8,414 being reduced all the way down to $49. Then you can reframe this discount and make it BIG, without being ridiculous. “You can have this $421 value for the low, low rate of $49! That’s over 80% off the total value! And just a mere 13 cents a day… A price that anyone could afford!” See how I was able to reframe that a couple different times? As you’ve probably noticed, each of these lessons offers you a new tool to build your copywriting fluency. Once you speak the language of copy, and you binge it, it will just make sense to do all these things naturally!

Aside from the recap section, another way to offer a price anchor is by comparing apples to oranges. Think of it like comparing a McDonalds cheeseburger to a T-bone steak. Here’s a Real Example from The Buyout Millionaires Club promo at Agora Financial: The only tool that can help you get ahead of big money moves… our backtests showed that this indicator could have given readers a chance to see gains like the historical examples I’ve shown you already… Gains like… $27,000, $42,333 and even an extraordinary $95,833 in a Matter of DAYS How much would that be worth to you? Before you answer, consider this… When I used to run a hedge fund… We used to charge something called the 2-and-20 fee structure… Meaning you are charged a 2% management fee… AND you give the fund 20% of your returns

Remember how I said the One-Day Bonus Indicator showed it could deliver average returns totaling $24,829 every 9 days? That equates to $1,390,424 a year… With gains like that… Your fees would easily be over $250,000. Before talking about how much a subscription to the newsletter will cost ($2,000)… The copywriters first mention a cost of $250,000 for Wall Street fees. Apples to oranges. Offer a Guarantee

When you offer a guarantee, you are simply guaranteeing “results.” And a guarantee does not mean you must give someone their money back. A guarantee can offer anything. Usually, for cheaper front end offers, a money-back guarantee is appropriate. But for very expensive back end offers, where information is the product, a money back guarantee can spell disaster. Because people can buy, download the content, then refund. But, like I said, you can offer a guarantee without offering someone their money back. For a financial copywriting back end, you may see a guarantee like this: “We guarantee the chance to see 10x your money or we’ll work for free.” Also of note: these words don’t guarantee you “will” make 10x… They guarantee you the “chance to see 10x your money.” This way if the reader never invests a dime, but the guru still does his job of selecting 10x stocks, then the guru doesn’t owe the reader anything further. Whether the readers invest in the guru’s recommendations or not is their choice. Next, let’s look at the words: “work for free.” Generally, the guarantee is backed by a second year of the service for free. Meaning, if the service doesn’t produce 10x returns in the portfolio, the second year of the service is free. The first reaction everyone ALWAYS has to this guarantee is: “Why would I want a free service that didn’t work?

That question is tremendously valid… but apparently inconsequential. Because financial publishers have been running promos with that guarantee for a long, long time with great success… so… there’s that. Here’s our guarantee for The 70 Cent Crypto: Limit the Spots or Quantity (Scarcity) I wrote this entire book and when I reached this point, I admit, I had a mini panic attack. Because I thought I might have completely overlooked a critical fifth pillar to copywriting. And I imagined I would look like a total fool with egg all over my face… Even after saying again and again, “All you need is these FOUR things.” That potential “fifth” pillar… Urgency… and its alter ego Scarcity.

While it is very powerful, I don’t think I would label urgency as fundamental as The Big 4. You see, when you are reading copy, I encourage you to perform active reading… And dissect every line and try to understand which of The Big 4 the writer was trying to communicate. Because if you can decode copywriting through active reading, you can binge. And if you binge you’ll recognize the patterns for how master copywriters communicate The Big 4.

Urgency says “get in by this date…” But Scarcity says, “get in by this date… if you still can.” It signals to the reader… Maybe there will still spots available for you. Maybe not. Who knows? Because Scarcity is sort of a one-trick-pony that triggers a sensation of “exclusion” when coupled with Urgency, it is more appropriately

Urgency and Scarcity are very powerful when wielded properly. And while I think you can use them sparingly to great effect, they have a big role to play in the offer section. Right before asking for the sale, it’s very common to see the copywriter limit the spots available and the window of time to get into them. The Money Zone does it right after the guarantee: Ask for the Sale

said “ask for the sale” instead of “close” on purpose. Here is a subtle nuance of psychology that most folks don’t know about or practice… When you close, you want to instruct the reader on what to do… But you don’t want to TELL them what to do. And therein lies the nuance. Instead, you present what is called a “Crossroads Close.
==========

- Your Highlight on page 136-136 | Added on Tuesday, June 18, 2024 3:28:02 PM

Crossroads Close The crossroads close positions the reader at a crossroads where he must choose a path. The crossroads close will usually go like this… “You now have two choices. You can choose to join me and make all this money / experience all these incredible benefits… And have yourself a brand new, incredible life. Or you can click away and go back to the life you’ve had before reading this. The life you’ve always had.” When phrased like that, it sure doesn’t seem like much of a choice. Some folks offer a third choice, “try to figure all this stuff out on your own, with no help… Even though it took me 10 years to figure it out and I’m a professional.” But based on everything I’ve seen in psychology papers, it is my opinion that the fewer choices, the better. Why water down the contrast of the two original choices? Anyways, when the reader looks at the original two choices it doesn’t seem like much of a choice at all. But it still is a choice. That’s the subtlety of it. The reader is given the OPTION to be a stubborn ox and say “no…” Even though it makes no logical sense to do so in the context of a crossroad close. But a choice is all the reader wants

Even though many salesmen take the: “you’d have to be an idiot to say no to this. Don’t even think about saying no, you dummy,” approach. At the end of the offer section the reader knows they are being sold… Or they should know by now. They know the Urgency and Scarcity is meant to push them. And they want the freedom of autonomy. The freedom to say “No.” So what does that look like in copy? Here’s how The Money Zone did it

You’ll see the writer present the crossroads close. Then tell the reader the decision is totally theirs. Of course while reinforcing how obvious the choice is. Then at this point, the copywriter has done all he can do. The copywriter will quickly sum up the opportunity, the urgency, the scarcity… And then leave the reader to their final decision to click or not click. The pitch is over. Just the big, colorful button remains

Some copywriters like to drop an FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) after the sign off. The FAQ basically pulls out each individual objection, or the most common ones, and addresses them directly. I’m not a fan of FAQs. For one, it’s more work on the copywriter to re-answer questions that should have already been addressed in the copy. Second, there is no flow or conversation control when it comes to an FAQ. The way FAQs are written, question by question… Allows the reader to freely jump around the page and scan from one question to the next. In phone sales they say you need to control the conversation. An FAQ takes that control away from the copywriter: the seller, who should control the conversation. There is a natural and even forced breakage of attention from one idea to the next in an FAQ section. And the inevitable repeating of information the reader has “already seen before.” What’s the point of writing a coherent, story-driven, sales letter that “shows” instead of “tells…” Just to make a list that tells after it’s all over? Sure, the copywriter can weave sales messages into FAQ… And I know of very successful sales letters with immense FAQ sections (Jim Rickards’ IMPACT System jumps into mind)… But personally, I’m not a fan. Just write compelling copy and the FAQ becomes unnecessary. You are free to write one if you want… Completely your choice

Know Your Real Edge and Don’t Fake It It is honorable for a man to admit his fears, resistance, and edge of practice. It is simply true that each man has his limit, his capacity for growth, and his destiny. But it is dishonorable for him to lie to himself or others about his real place. He shouldn’t pretend he is more enlightened than he is—nor should he stop short of his actual edge.

If you have deluded yourself and feel that you are not afraid, then you are lying to yourself. All men are afraid, unless they are perfectly free. If you cannot admit this, you are pretending to yourself, and to others. Your friends will feel your fear, even if you do not. Thus, they will lose trust in you, knowing you are deluding yourself, lying to yourself, and are therefore likely to lie to them, consciously or unconsciously.

Their lives are relatively secure and comfortable, but dead. They lack the aliveness, the depth, and the inspirational energy that is the sign of a man living at his edge. If you are this kind of man who is hanging back, working hard perhaps, but not at your real edge, other men will not be able to trust that you can and will help them live at their edge and give their fullest gift.

Make your life an ongoing process of being who you are, at your deepest, most easeful levels of being. Everything other than this process is secondary. Your job, your children, your wife, your money, your artistic creations, your pleasures—they are all superficial and empty, if they are not floating in the deep sea of your conscious loving.

Do whatever it takes. And from this depth of being, live the details of your life. But if you postpone the process of submerging yourself in the source for the sake of taking care of business first, your life will be spent in hours and days of business, and then it will be gone. Only if you are well grounded in that which is larger than life will you be able to play life with humor, knowing that each task is a mirage of necessity.

Never Change Your Mind Just to Please a Woman If a woman suggests something that changes a man’s perspective, then he should make a new decision based on his new perspective. But he should never betray his own deepest knowledge and intuition in order to please his woman or “go along” with her.

Your Purpose Must Come Before Your Relationship Every man knows that his highest purpose in life cannot be reduced to any particular relationship. If a man prioritizes his relationship over his highest purpose, he weakens himself, disserves the universe, and cheats his woman of an authentic man who can offer her full, undivided presence.

Your woman will be more fulfilled with 30 minutes a day of undivided attention and ravishing love than she will with a few hours of your weak and divided presence when your heart really isn’t into it. Time you spend with your woman should be time you really want to be with her more than anything else. If you’d rather be doing something else, she’ll feel it. Both of you will be dissatisfied.

If you are going to tryst with women and world at all, better to go all the way and ravish them from the depths of your true core, blooming them open with the wide gifts of your unrelenting heart. Otherwise, if you sheepishly penetrate them to gratify your own needs, your woman and the world will feel your lack of dedication, depth, and truth. Rather than yielding in love to your loving, they will distract you, suck your energy, and draw you into endless complications, so that your life and relationship become an almost constant search for release from constraint.

It is not the amount of time but the quality of the interaction that most influences a child’s growth. Children are exquisitely sensitive to emotional tone. If you are not full in your core, aligned with your deepest purpose and living a life of authentic commitment, your children will feel it.

Don’t Get Lost in Tasks and Duties Whatever the specifics of a man’s purpose, he must always refresh the transcendental element of his life through regular meditation and retreat. A man should never get lost in the details of his life and forget that, ultimately and in truth, life amounts to nothing other than what is the deepest truth of this present moment. Tasks don’t get a man anywhere more conscious or free than he is capable of being in this present moment.

Tasks are important, but no amount of duties adds up to love, freedom, or full consciousness. You cannot do enough, nor can you do the right things, so that you will finally feel complete.

The most erotic moment for a woman is feeling that you are Shiva, the divine masculine: unperturbable, totally loving, fully present, and all-pervading. She cannot move you, because you already are what you are, with or without her. She cannot scare you away, because you already penetrate her in fearless love, pervading her heart and body. She cannot distract you, because your one-pointed commitment to truth will not bend to her wiles. Feeling this hugeness of love and freedom in you, she can trust you, utterly, and surrender her testing in celebration of love.

Basically, most men are afraid of, or disgusted by, feminine emotions. That’s why you try to fix them or escape from them. “I’ll come back later when you can act like a reasonable human being,” you might say. One of the deepest feminine pleasures is when a man stands full, present, and unreactive in the midst of his woman’s emotional storms. When he stays present with her, and loves her through the layers of wildness and closure, then she feels his trustability, and she can relax.

the statement of a friend, not a lover. As friends, you want to treat each other fairly and give each other space and independence. As lovers, you and your woman are more than just friends. You are playing the full dynamic of masculine and feminine polarity. Wouldn’t you like your woman to be a goddess and offer you her feminine gifts? To evoke them, you must offer her your masculine gifts. One of your most valuable gifts is the ability to see all the options and make a decision based on this view of all the potential outcomes.

And, more importantly for the intimacy, if you don’t contribute to her masculine decision making process, the two of you will become depolarized by each other’s energy. She’ll be in the masculine, you’ll be neutral, and there will be nobody in the feminine pole This is fine for short periods of time, but if it becomes chronic, then the two of you will begin to feel like friends rather than lovers. The attractive juiciness of polarity will be replaced by two buddies discussing options. If you refuse to offer your masculine gift by saying things like, “I don’t really care.

About 80% of all men have a more masculine sexual essence. These men, of which you are probably one, are attracted to all things feminine. Not just feminine women, but anything with feminine energy, anything which is radiant, alive, enlivening, relaxing, and moving. Feminine energy gets you out of your head and into your body. Music, beer, nature, women, they are all forms of feminine energy.

If you are like most men, a radiant woman can inspire you for hours or days. Remember, the desire she arouses in you is a blessing in itself. Acting on that desire and pursuing her is another matter entirely, dependent on whether such an action would truly serve both of you or not. But the mere inspiration felt while beholding a radiant woman is one of nature’s gifts to you: the gift of feminine blessing.

If you want your woman to be your spiritual and sexual consort, not just your housemate, you must skillfully maintain your household and livelihoods so that the potency of your union is not diminished. She can be the mother of your children as well as your business partner, as long as these functions do not cut into the primacy of your purpose: to serve one another’s enlightenment through your unwavering commitment to love, and to enliven one another’s core by the bodily transmission of love via sexual polarity.

Once she feels your neediness, once she feels that you need her more than she needs you, she will never trust your masculine core. The priority of the masculine core is mission, purpose, or direction in life. The priority of the feminine core is the flow of love in intimacy. If a woman feels your feminine is stronger than hers—if she feels that the intimacy is more important to you than to he—then she will naturally animate her masculine. She will want space, she will want freedom to pursue her own direction, and she will be repulsed by your clinginess.

Sometimes a woman will make a request of her man in plain English, not to get him to do something, but to see if he is so weak that he will do it. In other words, she is testing his capacity to do what is right, not what she is asking for. In such cases, if the man does what his woman asks, she will be disappointed and angry. The man will have no idea why she is so angry or what could possibly please her. He must remember that her trust is engendered not by him fulfilling her requests, but by him magnifying love, consciousness, and success in their lives, in spite of her requests.

And the divine feminine settles for nothing less than the divine masculine.

Women are always wanting divine masculine presence in a man, regardless of their specific complaint or mood. A man should hear his woman’s complaints like warning bells, and then do his best to align his life with his truth and purpose. However, if he believes in the literal content of her complaint, he will immediately go off course, for the content reflects her present mood more than a careful observation of his tendencies over time. Her complaint should be valued as a reminder to “get it together,” and perhaps as an indication as to how. But more often than not, the specifics of her complaint do not describe the real, underlying action or tendency that needs to be changed.

The thing your woman is complaining about is rarely the thing she is complaining about. It is a mistake to believe the content of what she is saying, and then respond to her complaints, point by point. When she complains about financial issues, she is usually feeling a lack in your masculine capacity to direct your life with clarity, purpose, integrity, and wisdom. The money itself is secondary. If you were poor but totally conscious, happy, full of integrity, fearless, humorous, loving and giving your fullest gift to the world and to your woman, she wouldn’t complain about lack of money.

She Doesn’t Really Want to Be Number One A woman sometimes seems to want to be the most important thing in her man’s life. However, if she is the most important thing, then she feels her man has made her the number one priority and is not fully dedicated or directed to divine growth and service. She will feel her man’s dependence on her for his happiness, and this will make her feel smothered by his neediness and clinging. A woman really wants her man to be totally dedicated to his highest purpose—and also to love her fully. Although she would never admit it, she wants to feel that her man would be willing to sacrifice their relationship for the sake of his highest purpose.

If you walk up to her, hold her in your arms, and laugh affectionately in the humor of the moment, she will feel your freedom, if it is for real. She will feel it because it is communicated through your body.

There is never a shortage of women or feminine energy. If a man feels that there aren’t enough women, or that life isn’t giving him what he wants, he is simply negating his relationship to the feminine. This sense of starvation—“life is not sustaining me” or “there are no good women”—is usually rooted in a man’s early childhood relationship with his mother. Life itself is the feminine. There is never a shortage of feminine energy, only a resistance to receiving, trusting, and embracing

The natural sexiness of a young woman will always give you energy. You never need to deny this. But the awesome beauty and radiant ease of a deep woman can stop your mind, widen your heart, and suspend your body in the mystery of feminine grace, all in an instant, with a single gaze or touch, regardless of her body’s age. And in relationship with such a woman, there are no bounds to the rapture which may resonate through your union. Boundless feminine love-radiance and temporary physical sexiness are both blessings; you must decide, moment by moment, and year by year, which qualities you will invoke and venerate with your attention, praise, and union.

Turn Your Lust Into Gifts When a man sees a beautiful woman it is natural for him to feel energy in his body, which he usually interprets as sexual desire. Rather than dispersing this energy in mental fantasy, a man should learn to circulate his heightened energy. He should breathe fully, circulating the energy fully throughout his body. He should treat his heightened energy as a gift which could heal and rejuvenate his body, and, through his service, heal the world. Through these means, his desire is converted into fullness of heart. His lust is converted into service. His desire is not converted by denying sexual attraction, but by enjoying it fully, circulating it through his body (without allowing it to stagnate as mental fantasy), and returning it to the world, from his heart.

If you are a man, you have probably found yourself inspired at some time or another by a woman. Such inspiration is usually temporary, because most men don’t know how to cultivate their relationship to the feminine. They tend to be inspired, and then spurt it out, through spasms of thought and ejaculation. Then they seek inspiration again, through more women, or through other feminine sources, such as alcohol, drugs, or nature. But if you learn to discipline your habits of building up and releasing mental and sexual tension, you can continually cultivate and magnify your inspiration. You can wean yourself from the addictive cycles of sexuality and intoxication. You can make use of the native force of sexual desire, for your woman and for other women, and convert your tendency toward fantasy and lust into the force of inspiration.

When you feel sexual lust or desire for any woman, breathe deeply and allow the feeling of desire to magnify. And allow it to magnify more. Don’t let the energy become lodged in your head or genitals, but circulate it throughout your body. Using your breath as the instrument of circulation, bathe every cell in the stimulated energy. Inhale it into your heart, and then feel outward from your heart, feeling the world as if it were your lover.

When a man denies his desire for the feminine, either by choice or due to familiarity, it is a sign of his depolarization even toward the world. He may seek a mistress in order to re-invigorate him, but this is usually only a temporary and complicated solution, since it is only a matter of time before his mistress also becomes familiar, and thus tiresome.

Therefore, the main cure is to give yourself to others. Whenever you notice that you are mulling over your own problems, knotting energy into your body as tension, take that energy and create a gift for others. It could be as simple as doing the dishes in the sink, or as complex as building a business that will benefit others. Convert into service the energy that is knotting up the front of your body. Your tension is only the energy of a gift that has become backed up, unexpressed, in your body.

Intimate relationship is never the priority in a masculine man’s life and always the priority in a feminine woman’s life. If a man has a masculine sexual essence, then his priority is his mission, his direction toward greater release, freedom, and consciousness. If a woman has a feminine sexual essence, then her priority is the flow of love in her life, including her relationship with a man whom she can totally trust, in body, emotion, mind, and spirit.

There are masculine and feminine gifts in intimacy, and each gift comes with its own responsibility. The direction of growth of a relationship is primarily the man’s responsibility. The energy of an intimacy—pleasure, sexual flow, and vitality—is primarily the woman’s responsibility. A simplified way of saying this is that the man is responsible for the woman’s depth of love, or openness of mood, and the woman is responsible for the man’s “erection” or energy in the body.

A man in the process of growing will often soften his direction and seek a compromise with his woman, playing Mr. Nice Guy. But a superior man will not settle for less than the fullest incarnation of love of which he and his woman are capable. With compassion, he slices through all bullshit and demands authenticity and humor. It’s as if he were saying to his woman, “The divine way or the highway!” It’s the same masculine insistence on direction that a weaker man will demand. But rather than wanting his woman to follow his personal direction, a superior man wants her to move in the direction that most serves her growth in love and happiness.

You can go out into the woods and sing and dance and laugh with your friends. For men who have become rigidly stuck in their masculine direction, without allowing the flow of joy and sharing in their lives, this is good medicine.

The cure for lack of purpose is to be challenged to live at your edge, since you have lost the capacity to live there by yourself.

Austerity means to eliminate the comforts and cushions in your life that you have learned to snuggle into and lose wakefulness. Take away anything that dulls your edge. No newspapers or magazines. No TV. No candy, cookies, or sweets. No sex. No cuddling. No reading of anything at all while you eat or sit on the toilet. Reduce working time to a necessary minimum. No movies. No conversation that isn’t about truth, love, or the divine. If you take on these disciplines for a few weeks, as well as any other disciplines that may particularly cut through your unique habits of dullness, then your life will be stripped of routine distraction. All that will be left is the edge you have been avoiding by means of your daily routine. You will have to face the basic discomfort and dissatisfaction that is the hidden texture of your life. You will be alive with the challenge of living your truth, rather than hiding from it. Unadorned suffering is the bedmate of masculine growth.

By putting all your attention into work, TV, sex, and reading, your suffering remains unpenetrated, and the source remains hidden. Your life becomes structured entirely by your favorite means of sidestepping the suffering you rarely allow yourself to feel. And when you do touch the surface of your suffering, perhaps in the form of boredom, you quickly pick up a magazine or the remote control.

The other means, besides austerity, for rediscovering your masculine core is through challenge. The more superficial forms of challenge include activities like mountain climbing, ropes courses, competitive sports, and boot camp. These forms of physical challenge instantly enliven the masculine sense of purpose and direction, in men and women.

Deeper forms of challenge involve directly giving your gift in ways that have been blocked by your fear. If you have always been afraid of public speaking, you can take on the challenge of speaking in public once a week for three months. If you fail and miss an appointment one week, the following week you must give three talks. If you have always wanted to write a novel, but could never finish one, you tell your friends that you are going to complete one chapter a week (or a month) for the next year. Every time you don’t complete your weekly goal, you owe your friends $100. If you don’t complete your yearly goal, you owe them $10,000.

Spend time every day in solitude, with no distractions. Just sit, for ten minutes. No fidgeting, no channel surfing, no magazine thumbing. Just be, exactly as you are, not trying to change anything. Stay with your suffering, until you fall through it and intuit the groundless source of your life.

Cut through the bullshit and talk with each other straight. If you feel your friend is wasting his life, tell him so, because you love him. Welcome such criticism from your friends. Suggest challenges for each other to take on, in order to bring each other through the fears which limit your surrender in gifting. Always agree on consequences for not persisting in the challenge.

You should alternate these kinds of “cutting through the bullshit” gatherings with masculine celebrations. Even during these celebrations, though, there should be a challenge to remain conscious and undistracted. They are not occasions for lapsing from fullness, but for communing beyond fear. Perhaps you can all go swimming in ice cold water together. Or drink to the point of inebriation and then spend the rest of the night chanting hymns of the mystery of existence—nobody allowed to drift. Whatever you do, share as much loving as you can with your friends, without settling for mediocrity or less than each man’s fullest gift.

Twain’s study was so isolated from the main house that his family took to blowing a horn to attract his attention for meals. Moving forward in history, consider the screenwriter and director Woody Allen. In the forty-four-year period between 1969 and 2013, Woody Allen wrote and directed forty-four films that received twenty-three Academy Award nominations—an absurd rate of artistic productivity. Throughout this period, Allen never owned a computer, instead completing all his writing, free from electronic distraction, on a German Olympia SM3 manual typewriter. Allen is joined in his rejection of computers by Peter Higgs, a theoretical physicist who performs his work in such disconnected isolation that journalists couldn’t find him after it was announced he had won the Nobel Prize. J.K. Rowling, on the other hand, does use a computer, but was famously absent from social media during the writing of her Harry Potter novels—

The ubiquity of deep work among influential individuals is important to emphasize because it stands in sharp contrast to the behavior of most modern knowledge workers—a group that’s rapidly forgetting the value of going deep.

Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.
