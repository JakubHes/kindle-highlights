associative group influence is more complex. This strategy requires that you link your product to a certain societal group, while often alienating others. This can be done in two ways, either by (1) closely associating your product with the target group through advertising that specifically appeals to the attitudes and values of that group, or by (2) disassociating your product from other groups within society, in order to make it appear more accepted, or, in the cases of younger audiences, simply more “cool.”

Does your product lend itself to using the human need to belong appeal? If it does, don’t just think about ways to describe its features and benefits. Put at least equal effort into telling your prospects how buying your product makes them (aspirational), keeps them (associative), or helps them show the world that they’re not a part of a particular group (dissociative).

STAGE ONE: Precontemplation—People in this stage are either ignorant of your product’s existence—“What the heck is a Bloopo Burger?”—or they’re unaware they need it.  STAGE TWO: Contemplation—Prospects in this stage are aware of your product and have thought about using it. “Hmmm...I should check out those Bloopo Burgers someday.”  STAGE THREE: Preparation—This is the planning phase. Your prospect is thinking about buying from you, but needs more information about your product’s benefits and advantages. “I’d like to buy a Bloopo Burger...it sure looks good, but what the heck is in it? Is it healthier? Better tasting? What’s it cost?”  STAGE FOUR: Action—Success! Your prospect has arrived at the coveted action, or purchase phase. “Here’s my credit card, gimme my damned Bloopo!”  STAGE FIVE: Maintenance—A nice place for your prospects to be. In this phase, your product has become part of their everyday lives.

Some of your prospects are in stage one, while others wouldn’t think of eating any other burger, in stage five. You have two options to tackle this: 1. Create ads that address all five stages. This lets your prospects focus on whatever stage is personally relevant to them. Simply include all the details someone would need to be fully informed about a product they might know little, if anything, about. 2. Create a series of ads that, throughout a period of time, progress from stage one to stage five. Stage one, therefore, introduces your product to the marketplace. Each successive ad builds upon the last, and can begin highlighting key features and benefits.

the Inoculation Theory is used to reinforce a consumer’s existing attitudes toward a product or service by presenting a “weak” argument that tricks the consumer into defending his position and therefore strengthening his attitude. The three steps are: 1. Warn of an impending attack. 2. Make a weak attack. 3. Encourage a strong defense.

By attacking your ideas and decisions (or brand preferences, as in this example), inoculation encourages you to use critical thought to defend them. Basically, it tricks you into thinking more deeply about your own position, which reinforces your thoughts and feelings.

Therefore, you should feature colorful charts and graphs, and facts, figures, and quotes from respected intellectuals and professionals.

YOU LEARNED that in order for your advertising to be successful, you must first be aware of what blocks your readers from understanding your message. YOU LEARNED that your readers don’t care about your big vocabulary, only what you can do for them. That means you use shorter words, sentences, and paragraphs. YOU LEARNED that advertising copy doesn’t have to follow all the rules of a college composition. Your copy has one job: to sell, Sell, SELL! YOU LEARNED how to use questions to draw people into your copy and keep them reading. Right? YOU LEARNED how to use pronouns, such as the words you and I to make your copy sound personal.

Don’t forget that just one female black widow can blow out four to nine egg sacs every summer, each containing up to 750 eggs incubating a fresh new load of up to 750 spiderlings in just 14 to 30 days. Worse still, each venomous arachnid lives—no, mates and breeds!—inside your home with your children and pets, for up to three full years! Try killing them yourself if you must, but think about this: If you miss killing just one egg-engorged female (or one of her hundreds of nearly microscopic crawling babies), you’ll suffer a full-blown arachnid infestation in no time! I’ve been at war with black widows for the past five years, and there’s nothing worse than feeling something crawling across your skin at night when you’re in bed. Well,

Why be just another person in your industry who does nothing new, nothing worth noting, nothing that gets people talking and buying?

Company A’s headline reads, “MUGGER STOPPER!” and features a close-up of a woman’s hand holding the product as if she were showing you the label. Yawn. I can’t think of another product that offers so much dramatic possibility, yet this company opted to show their product doing...er, nothing at all. Company B, on the other hand, was smart. Their headline, “Stop Muggers at the Push of a Button!” showed an illustration of a woman spraying a group of sleazy-looking attackers who surround her in a semicircle. Each of the thugs is shown in various stages of distress: on their knees, flat on the ground, coughing, grabbing their faces, screaming, and running away.

See what’s happening? The more ways you justify the purchase of your product, the more likely you’ll influence people to buy. So you take them by the hand and tell the whole story. You pile on the benefits (Length-Implies-Strength), show pictures to help them see it, slather on the testimonials (social proof), and back it up with a warranty (to quell fear). By the time you’re done, you have quite a convincing (and often lengthy) sales piece.

Drew: Well nothing! Advertising is not supposed to be entertainment! You may be entertained by it, but that’s not its purpose. It’s not a creativity contest. It’s not meant to grace the walls of the Louvre in Paris. It’s also not poetry, comedy, or a riddle to be figured out. Advertising is not about winning awards for being tricky, off-the-wall, or ingenious. Advertising—plain and simple—is about selling products and services.

But something doesn’t have to be clever or tricky to grab and hold a prospect’s attention. You don’t write copy to appeal to the masses that aren’t buyers for your product as a way to thank them for reading your ad! And those who are interested in the offer don’t need entertainment in order to buy. They need benefits. Facts. An offer. And reassurance that you’ll deliver what you promise.

To wrap up on the obligation piece, this is not “cold hearted”.

If Warren Buffett never became the investor he is today, billions of dollars would go to waste. By signing a giving pledge, he will do more for society by himself than thousands of workers combined. In addition, he can pay for thousands of people to pursue their own dream of working for charities. Just remember, without his donations they wouldn’t be able to work in the first place

Overachievement is Also Wasted Time: Given that our blog attracts a lot of overachievers, we think many will also recognize the damaging effects of overkill. It is incredibly inefficient to beat a dead horse when no more value can be extracted. As an example, if you score a 90% on a test and the person who receives a 100% obtains the same grade (an A) there is absolutely no point in trying to go to 100%. You should focus your efforts on another test and if 90% is achieved in each one, then move on. The same philosophy applies to business as well. If a specific demographic is no longer giving you the appropriate return on investment, you start looking for a new demographic, create a new product and adjust your strategy

If you’re really having a tough time gaining weight you can switch to more carbs vs. proteins but we would wager the vast majority will benefit from a protein based morning. Beyond the protein aspect we would choose fruits that are acidic. We have no science to back this up only experience.

Now you’ll have a pair of shoes that will last * at least* 5 years

Play Lie Detection: This is another immensely valuable skill. Being able to tell if a person’s statements are true or false. Instead of running around asking a billion questions to everyone you know we suggest adding this to your daily or weekly routine. You’re going to simply take a topic you know extremely well and ask a person (friend or new acquaintance) “Hey I don’t know anything about XXX can you tell me about it?” Then see how long it takes for them to start making up information. You’ll find that people do not want to admit to being wrong (everyone’s a genius) so you can build a rolodex of facial and body reactions when they go into “making up information” mode.

Hand Out Harmful Personal Information: No, we don’t mean you go out and give bad advice, instead you are finding out if you can trust person X. This means you take one piece of information that would be “bad” if people knew about it and see if it gets leaked. The trick is to make sure you only tell one person. The second trick, if you want to lean on the safe side, is to give out information that really isn’t true. By doing this you’ll be able to build up character qualities of people you trust. Most people are not trustworthy and this is absolutely fine for social interactions.But… It would be deadly if money is ever involved

Show them the before and after result… what your results looked like before and after their recommendation.

The key is to build a framework for why one may be better than the other and see if it fits your personality. That said we are saying one thing for sure. If you don’t learn to sell you’ll be significantly poorer financially and emotionally. If you can’t sell a product and can’t sell yourself to other people (going on dates or obtaining your first career position)… It won’t be easy

Wall Street (Synthesis) Make no mistake, Wall Street is also sales. When a real estate agent sells a house, he collects a fee based on a percentage of the total sale value of the home.

Our Current Best Recommendation: Broadly speaking we think focus should center around sectors that are growing rapidly. This means we would recommend M&A within sectors such as healthcare, technology, pharmaceuticals and energy. While many companies will have an M&A group that is broad (not sector focused) the reasoning is clear. If a sector has many new companies popping up left right and center, it is likely that these companies will either go public or be acquired. This means more deal activity which means more fees and more money for YOU

We’re going to use investment banking (M&A advisory) as the best example. Most people think investment banking revolves around “investing in stocks”… we call these people “uneducated”. Investment banking (M&A) means you sell a Company to another company and collect a fee. This is no different than real estate sales (you’re just selling a much more expensive item, a company vs. a home). You collect a fee based on a % of the total sale price… Just like a real estate agent. There are other aspects to investment banking but there are boutiques that *primarily* sell companies (not much else is offered). So we’ll go with a public example of a Company that focuses on the M&A side.Moelis60

Story, Example, Tell (“SET” Framework): The goal of your entire message is to relate to your specific target audience on an emotional level by telling your Story. After this you provide Examples of the benefits you found from the solution being offered… followed by Telling the audience the reason to buy and of course to click purchase. Once you understand the SET framework, you’ll see it everywhere. Get rich websites always have a story of a guy who was broke and in debt (targeting masses) and muscle building websites always go with the “I was skinny or I was fat” followed by the story and current look. This is how it should be done, and our framework is easy to remember. If you stick to the basic SET framework, you can then layer in more complex items and other sales tactics you’ve learned along the way

Influencers the Holy Grail of Sales: Okay maybe not the Holy Grail, but it is by far the highest ROI you can receive if you’re able to get your products into the hands of an influencer (automatic closed sales!). An influencer is someone with hundreds of thousands (even millions) of followers on a specific social platform. If they can validate your product by recommending it you’ll make an egregious ROI especially if you can get it on the cheap (offer influencers free products). The one catch, is that people are becoming more aware of “paid advertising”. So you’ll have to give up the product (take the loss) at an attempt to land a whale (influencer). If they can go to bat for the product without being paid to do so, you’ve hit pay dirt. While this is certainly not related to copywriting it is 1,000% related to sales. Keep a list of influencers in the back of your mind when you’re launching your product and remember to check (their followers) to make sure they are real

Stalk Your Competitors: Pay attention to your industry only. There is no reason to pay attention to other sectors (losing valuable time). Information can be gained when watching the advertisements of your competitors. You should visit their websites, read their ads, watch their social media accounts and track their web traffic. You’ll get a knack for understanding how much they are making, if they are buying traffic (lower profit margins) and what items are selling the best for them. While you won’t learn everything, you’ll certainly pick up a few new ideas to add to your current sales funnel. As a note, copying the competition is just not a good use of time. You’ve already seen copy-cat websites for content… It is even worse for products. There has to be something a tad unique (it can be the sales technique/branding if nothing else) but it just can’t be a regurgitated product. The difference between copying and learning from the competition? The strategy. Ask why it is being done that way and then ask if it will fit into your model. Sometimes it actually won’t! Just remember to focus on the strategy/messaging that they are using. As a final note, even though we’ve clearly stated copying won’t work. Thousands of people will try it anyway and they will burn valuable time trying to replicate something that doesn’t fit into their strategy/process correctly

Marketing Wins: Since you’re towards the end of this book you already know the answer: “Most products add minimal value and generate sales due to marketing”. Brand name products, status items and magic pills are lucrative businesses because people don’t want to do any actual work. The supplements industry is probably the worst as guys inject themselves with steroids and sell $50 bottles of XYZ product to build muscle when the steroids themselves cost significantly less than the fake bottles that “build muscle”. Why does it work? Well… people would rather take a “magic pill” than do actual work (heavy lifting, dieting) or even worse injecting a product “invasive process” (i.e.pain). Funny enough, that is exactly what they are doing to sell the bottles in the first place. In short, the product doesn’t need to add a lot of value. Your product simply needs to make the person feel good and avoid any sort of pain (do not try to convince people to do ANY actual work for ANY product: diet, skin, make money online etc

Split All Traffic: This is similar to “A/B” testing. If you’re going to launch a product you A/B test meaning you send one idea to one half and the other idea to the second half (within the same demographic). You then choose the one with the better response rate. You’ll do the same exact thing with all of your traffic since you’re going to watch it like a hawk. Figure out what type of user is converting on page A and if you find a trend then create a separate page to tweak for the second sales funnel. This is essentially a secondary “A/B” test. You’ve optimized correctly for the first group of people. Now you’re optimizing based on the results for when it goes live. Now you know why everyone talks about sales funnels in affiliate marketing.Note: you can also create a landing page where the person gets to the offer after * trying to leave* the page (many websites use this tactic)

Step 2) Avoid the Big Mistakes If you avoid big mistakes when you’re meeting new people you’ll see a step function improvement in your social life. Since you’re checked in and living in the present, here are the quickest improvement points: 1) Steer the conversation to the present moment. No one cares about the past or the future in a bar or nightclub. Focus on now. Structure conversations around observations of your surroundings. Other people interacting, the design of the venue, so on and so forth. Most women enjoy gossiping so making observations about others typically works well 2) Under no circumstances do you immediately ask for their name. In general, most will ask for your name particularly if you’re grabbing drinks already. In addition, try to avoid topics such as technology, work and politics. It can work… Just not very likely (besides none of those are interesting topics in a social setting anyway). Knowing information such as their name is a form of investment in the other person; you don’t care to know the name of a girl who hasn’t already shown interest (such as my asking your name). Discussing “serious” issues is a form of investment; you don’t care if a girl is on the path to several life mistakes unless she’s

Draw a line between the bathrooms and the bar and look around for the stair cases (if there are any). Stand in an area where people constantly walk by so you don’t have to run around. The line between the bar and the staircases/bathrooms are the traffic flow zones. The reason to stand in these areas is due to the fact that the pack separates. It is much more common to see people alone or in pairs as they move back and forth from these vortex zones. It’s a much higher ROI and is better than running around trying to talk to groups of 5+ who are fist pumping in a circle

Always start a conversation with an assumption. It doesn’t have to be great. Anything about the present moment and make sure it is not offensive or an outrageous undeserved complement.“Hey I bet that is XXX (specific assumption)” is just fine. An assumption works best because it makes a directional and tonal choice right away in the interaction, the question “How are you today?” could cause a girl to answer “Awesome” to “Terrible” and enter into an unhelpful context, as opposed to “That looks like XXXX which means you’re probably XXX. ” which gives her a positive attitude to adopt. Finally it takes more of the creative burden off her while shouldering it yourself, thus your interaction will feel as if it flows more, from her perspective

Step 3) Focus on Your Body Language and Clothing First Most worry about what to say to new people. Since we’ve already given that away with a basic assumption talking point, the bigger issue is typically how someone looks: 1) Dress as sharp as you can for the venue. If you’re wearing suits you should be in a nicer high end venue and it should fit extremely well (made to measure at minimum). If you’re in a lower end venue, nice jeans and shirts that show you’re in shape will work perfectly fine (you’re probably younger if you’re going to these venues where people over drink consistently)

If there is no one of interest at the moment, take a glance at the style of the guys who are chatting with girls you think are attractive (free chance to learn something). In the future, you will predict how well other men do with women and the dynamics of their relationships (lover vs.“kept boyfriend”) from style and body language alone. This will naturally help your standard assumption openers because you’ll end up being more and more accurate

Do not have any object sit in front of you while you’re standing. This means you’re not going to look at your phone (it would be placed in front of your chest) and it means your drinks are not going to be held in front of your chest (hold them to your side or set it on a bar/table).

Keep an open posture at all times. This means you do not cross your legs or your arms. Do not do anything that makes you look “closed up” which can also include hands in your pant pockets, coat pockets, head looking at the ground and head looking at your phone constantly. Closed posture is the easiest and most common issue. Most have closed postures because they are “uncomfortable” in the environment. Look no further than a dreaded office party to see closed posture on display

Do not “pre-sell” yourself. If she’s already responding then she’s already interested. Keep it casual and fast so you can get a day on the calendar before losing her interest 4) Once you're comfortable in conversations you can simply say "let’s go" when you're trying to move to another venue or go to your house/apartment 5) Remember that anything you send *will* be seen by her friends.

No need to do this and highlight it to them, simply leave bigger tips and they’ll notice without you telling them you did them a “favor”.

Also a good idea to use the observational skills and assumptions with the bouncers/doormen as well, these guys are often bored and commenting in a funny way on drunk people or girls is a good way to start and maintain a friendly relationship. They are typically 100x more interesting and valuable than “that guy from work” who you’ve been forced to drink with several times in the past 4) Make sure your wardrobe matches the venue which should be easy considering your personality already matches the area you’re in. Invest a few extra bucks building up a wardrobe for your regular venues. Also being slightly better dressed than the other guys is helpful for positive attention, whether this is by coordination or fit, or by going “one step up

Now that you’re used to socializing with strangers you’ll feel completely fine asking for phone numbers in the future. The best times to meet people are when you’re at a restaurant (showing up early as always), shopping for clothing or out grabbing groceries 4) The framework is quite simple. As you have noticed, we don’t use “specific lines” to sound like robots. Instead you should be in the venue for a reason. Simply say “what do you think about this or have you used this” and point/hold up product you’re talking about. After that you’ll talk for about 2x longer than you normally would at a nightlife venue, explaining why you’re interested in it and throw in a lot of details (filler) since direct talking does not work as well in day time environments. By talking for 2x longer than normal, there are several things that the person can grasp on to if they want to continue the conversation. If they do… well you continue down that path and eventually ask them if they live in the area (they likely do) and say you’d be interested in hanging out “this was fun we should hang out sometime”. Then as usual, hand them your phone (don’t ask for the phone number) they’ll typically just grab it and put in their information

Attractive women will have the option to be serial monogamists, as they do not have to accept “hook ups” since their market power allows them to set the price of their affection at whatever they want. These attractive women can also have discrete one night stands, so it is only the combination of good looks and a preference for strong bonding that would keep her out of the “hook up” pool

Don’t get legally married. If you decide to have a family do so without the government contract. Feel free to get the ring, have the ceremony and live together. Just don’t pay the higher tax rate and put yourself at risk to losing 50% of your assets at any time. You can also take the beneficial elements of marriage and construct those agreements yourself such as a health proxy for the medical rights of a spouse, survivor clause on real property, limited power of attorney etc. The main point is that a standard legal marriage comes with many negatives that an intelligent man would avoid, and a reasonable woman acting in good faith would be willing to avoid, and you can setup the agreements and general situation you want without the standard contract. If she is not okay with this idea, then you know what to do

Get in Shape: Step one is getting in good shape. There is no point in arguing about “looks”. Everyone can agree that looking good will do nothing but help you in dating and meeting people of importance. Humans are animals at the end of the day and we’re all biased to hang out with people that are physically more attractive. Ending any discussion about looks once and for all: looks, money and status are “passive game”, executing charisma is “active game”; the more you have of one the less you need of the other.“Passive game” expands your pool of prospects; “Active game” is how well you close them. Adjust Wardrobe: Once you’re in shape you’ll change your wardrobe and obtain fitting clothing. In a few years you should be able to afford a few made to measure suits (or custom suits) and if you’re starting out, something like Indochino or Suit Supply will work just fine. 2x a Week and Focus on Body Language: Going out 2x a week is more than enough. Go out on Thursday’s and Saturday’s. You’ll follow the outline listed above and improve on your overall social skills over time by talking to people using “assumption” openers.

If you’re in NYC we’ll bet you end up migrating towards the SoHo area. This will then make your life a lot easier as you incorporate talking to new people in your day to day life.

This is especially true in places like Eastern Europe/South East Asia.Remember, try to get RICH first, before deciding that its better abroad (you’ll be unsurprised to find that there is no real difference if you’re actually rich).

Benefits of a Relationship: Practically everyone will have a girlfriend during their 10 years of grind to accumulating a large amount of money (hopefully even less time!). That said there are a lot of benefits and to be clear, we’re not against dating a girl if you’re happy.Also, part of the shift in needing the girl the least is that she will be chasing you for a relationship, so if you’d like to continue to see other girls either casually and as it arises from your day to day interactions or in some sort of multiple long term arrangement, the ball is in your court.1) You’ll save money. If you meet a girl you like and she’s not a crazy person, then you’ll end up saving a lot more money. Not so much in cold hard cash, but quite a bit in time. Instead of going out until 3am in the morning twice a week you’ll be going out to dinner here and there or going to some sort of event.2) You’ll increase focus. With your schedule more stabilized you’ll be able to focus a lot more on your work. This means you’ll typically advance a lot further in any given time period when you’re in a stable relationship 3) You’ll get a better understanding of the girls you like. If a girl was interesting enough for you to put going out on hold for a period of time… there are a lot of characteristics that you like about her. Who knows if you will continue to date her in the future but it will give you a good glimpse of the qualities you like 4) By being in relationships here and there, you’ll decide if you want to have kids. This is a personal decision and we have no opinion on having kids. If you’d like to have kids great, if not… great as well. If you’re in a relationship that lasts more than 6 months or so, it’ll trigger you to think about your future

Relationships don’t take work. If the girl you’re dating demands too much time or too much of your resources either you’re not where you need to be financially or you are not that interested in the girl. If there is a lot of conflict all of the time just move on 2) Don’t expect any girl you date to be perfect. You should know the downsides of the girl you’re dating and decide if that is something your personality lines up well with. If a girl puts a lot of value in going to Broadway shows and dinner, then consider that a change in your lifestyle versus nightclubs and bars. If she’s more interested in going outdoors, then decide if you’re willing to adjust your social life to doing outdoor activities on a regular basis.3) The best advice for managing a relationship is “don’t ask for advice”. If you ask for advice on how to handle your own relationship then you’re going to lose the girl anyway. If you’re not willing to lose your girlfriend she’ll end up leaving you anyway. That is probably the most common mistake people make. It is also why we laugh when people pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars for relationship counseling 4) Make your lifestyle clear. If she doesn’t understand how you live your life, then you’ll create conflicts from day one. Make it clear and then see if she’s still interested. If not, it wasn’t going to work out anyway 5) Don’t let anything drag along. If you realize 3 months or 10 months down the line that it is not going to work, go ahead and end the relationship. It does not do you any favors and does not do her any favors as well. There is no reason to be nasty about it just separate on positive terms As you can see, there isn’t too much to add on relationships since this is too specific for each individual. If you find a girl you like that is attractive to you and fits your lifestyle well

Just remember the cardinal rule outlined at the beginning of this section “Whoever needs the other person the least is in control of the relationship”. Attractive women prefer strong men so by being needy or compliant with the demands of someone else over and over, that trait erodes (a huge negative). No woman on earth is interested in a needy guy who pines over a girl. This is also why there is no such thing as an ideal woman (doesn’t exist). If you find someone that fits your personality go ahead and run with it and don’t ask for advice

Besides if you’re rich, we will go ahead and guarantee you it will be impossible to be unattractive. Only people with extreme social issues will struggle if they are rich (this can be fixed within a year by going out a lot). So simply follow the outline here and you’ll be all set

How to Tell If She Is Interested If you’ve followed the framework outlined in this book, you’ll be able to catch on very rapidly. The premise is quite simple: they will put themselves in the vicinity for something to “just happen”. This is essentially the equivalent of “girl game”. They don’t make the first moves and they like to say everything “just happened”. Knowing this alone it is pretty easy to see if the girl is interested

Eye contact is the most obvious form of showing interest. If you’re getting direct eye contact for more than a few seconds then you’re foolish to not say anything. You’re even more foolish if she is playing with her hair and giving you direct eye contact 2) Hovering. Ever notice the vast majority of attractive girls are found in nice areas (nice gyms, nice wine bars, nice restaurants, etc.). This is their way of putting themselves in a situation for something to happen. The same is true within the location. They will stand near or around the group of guys they are interested in talking to 3) Standing in photos. If you’re in group photos with some friends and one girl constantly ends up next to you in the photo… She’s again interested. You are foolish to miss it once and a bigger fool if you find 3-5 photos and the same girl is constantly trying to be next to you in the photo 4) Leaving reminders at your place. This should also be obvious, but if you have a group of people over and one girl consistently “forgets” something at your place… She didn’t forget it. She left it there to create another interaction with you. There are always exceptions but if the item is worth more than a few bucks it’s typically not a mistake 5) Pushing the conversation. Girls are able to talk about nothing for hours, so they can certainly help you continue a conversation. If you find a girl is constantly trying to elongate the time she is spending with you… take the hint yet again! 6) Physical touching. This is another clear one, but if you accidentally bump into a girl or she tries to face your direction when navigating a crowded are (doesn’t turn) then she’s likely interested as well. She can easily move or make a negative reaction… if she doesn’t mind the contact, she’s very likely interested 7) Out of the blue contact. Any time a past fling/girlfriend contacts you “out of the blue” that is practically a guarantee that she is trying to re-kindle the relationship. Particularly obvious when she makes a statement such as “looking at old photos of us!” 8) If she dangles her heels she’s ready to leave. Thought this one was obvious but most can’t tell when a girl is done hanging out and would prefer to hang out alone instead. If she begins high heel shoe dangling after being out for an adequate amount of time (at least a couple of hours) there is a high likelihood she wants to leave the area 9) Licking her lips. We’ve hilariously seen guys miss that queue, if you’re unable to figure that one out… probably need to get out more! 10) Response time. Everyone knows this one but we’ll go ahead and add it. The faster she responds the more interested she is. If you are forced to wait for long periods of time… Skip and go to someone else. Unless she’s on a flight or has some sort of extreme circumstances, practically everyone is glued to their smartphones these days

Reading/Learning: We’re going to limit this to ~1 hour a day.Why? Well, all of the actual reading and learning needs to be done with a purpose. We have nothing against reading and learning, we just don’t see anyone getting paid to read books. Reading is extremely important if you want to be successful, the problem is that it “feels” like you’re actually doing work (you’re not!). So read with a purpose for about an hour a day. After that the real work involves actual changes to your online store, buying traffic and watching your competition like a hawk to make sure you pick up on any new marketing/sales tactics to use yourself
