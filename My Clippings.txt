associative group influence is more complex. This strategy requires that you link your product to a certain societal group, while often alienating others. This can be done in two ways, either by (1) closely associating your product with the target group through advertising that specifically appeals to the attitudes and values of that group, or by (2) disassociating your product from other groups within society, in order to make it appear more accepted, or, in the cases of younger audiences, simply more “cool.”

Does your product lend itself to using the human need to belong appeal? If it does, don’t just think about ways to describe its features and benefits. Put at least equal effort into telling your prospects how buying your product makes them (aspirational), keeps them (associative), or helps them show the world that they’re not a part of a particular group (dissociative).

STAGE ONE: Precontemplation—People in this stage are either ignorant of your product’s existence—“What the heck is a Bloopo Burger?”—or they’re unaware they need it.  STAGE TWO: Contemplation—Prospects in this stage are aware of your product and have thought about using it. “Hmmm...I should check out those Bloopo Burgers someday.”  STAGE THREE: Preparation—This is the planning phase. Your prospect is thinking about buying from you, but needs more information about your product’s benefits and advantages. “I’d like to buy a Bloopo Burger...it sure looks good, but what the heck is in it? Is it healthier? Better tasting? What’s it cost?”  STAGE FOUR: Action—Success! Your prospect has arrived at the coveted action, or purchase phase. “Here’s my credit card, gimme my damned Bloopo!”  STAGE FIVE: Maintenance—A nice place for your prospects to be. In this phase, your product has become part of their everyday lives.

Some of your prospects are in stage one, while others wouldn’t think of eating any other burger, in stage five. You have two options to tackle this: 1. Create ads that address all five stages. This lets your prospects focus on whatever stage is personally relevant to them. Simply include all the details someone would need to be fully informed about a product they might know little, if anything, about. 2. Create a series of ads that, throughout a period of time, progress from stage one to stage five. Stage one, therefore, introduces your product to the marketplace. Each successive ad builds upon the last, and can begin highlighting key features and benefits.

the Inoculation Theory is used to reinforce a consumer’s existing attitudes toward a product or service by presenting a “weak” argument that tricks the consumer into defending his position and therefore strengthening his attitude. The three steps are: 1. Warn of an impending attack. 2. Make a weak attack. 3. Encourage a strong defense.

By attacking your ideas and decisions (or brand preferences, as in this example), inoculation encourages you to use critical thought to defend them. Basically, it tricks you into thinking more deeply about your own position, which reinforces your thoughts and feelings.
