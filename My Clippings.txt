associative group influence is more complex. This strategy requires that you link your product to a certain societal group, while often alienating others. This can be done in two ways, either by (1) closely associating your product with the target group through advertising that specifically appeals to the attitudes and values of that group, or by (2) disassociating your product from other groups within society, in order to make it appear more accepted, or, in the cases of younger audiences, simply more “cool.”

Does your product lend itself to using the human need to belong appeal? If it does, don’t just think about ways to describe its features and benefits. Put at least equal effort into telling your prospects how buying your product makes them (aspirational), keeps them (associative), or helps them show the world that they’re not a part of a particular group (dissociative).

STAGE ONE: Precontemplation—People in this stage are either ignorant of your product’s existence—“What the heck is a Bloopo Burger?”—or they’re unaware they need it.  STAGE TWO: Contemplation—Prospects in this stage are aware of your product and have thought about using it. “Hmmm...I should check out those Bloopo Burgers someday.”  STAGE THREE: Preparation—This is the planning phase. Your prospect is thinking about buying from you, but needs more information about your product’s benefits and advantages. “I’d like to buy a Bloopo Burger...it sure looks good, but what the heck is in it? Is it healthier? Better tasting? What’s it cost?”  STAGE FOUR: Action—Success! Your prospect has arrived at the coveted action, or purchase phase. “Here’s my credit card, gimme my damned Bloopo!”  STAGE FIVE: Maintenance—A nice place for your prospects to be. In this phase, your product has become part of their everyday lives.

Some of your prospects are in stage one, while others wouldn’t think of eating any other burger, in stage five. You have two options to tackle this: 1. Create ads that address all five stages. This lets your prospects focus on whatever stage is personally relevant to them. Simply include all the details someone would need to be fully informed about a product they might know little, if anything, about. 2. Create a series of ads that, throughout a period of time, progress from stage one to stage five. Stage one, therefore, introduces your product to the marketplace. Each successive ad builds upon the last, and can begin highlighting key features and benefits.

the Inoculation Theory is used to reinforce a consumer’s existing attitudes toward a product or service by presenting a “weak” argument that tricks the consumer into defending his position and therefore strengthening his attitude. The three steps are: 1. Warn of an impending attack. 2. Make a weak attack. 3. Encourage a strong defense.

By attacking your ideas and decisions (or brand preferences, as in this example), inoculation encourages you to use critical thought to defend them. Basically, it tricks you into thinking more deeply about your own position, which reinforces your thoughts and feelings.

Therefore, you should feature colorful charts and graphs, and facts, figures, and quotes from respected intellectuals and professionals.

YOU LEARNED that in order for your advertising to be successful, you must first be aware of what blocks your readers from understanding your message. YOU LEARNED that your readers don’t care about your big vocabulary, only what you can do for them. That means you use shorter words, sentences, and paragraphs. YOU LEARNED that advertising copy doesn’t have to follow all the rules of a college composition. Your copy has one job: to sell, Sell, SELL! YOU LEARNED how to use questions to draw people into your copy and keep them reading. Right? YOU LEARNED how to use pronouns, such as the words you and I to make your copy sound personal.

Don’t forget that just one female black widow can blow out four to nine egg sacs every summer, each containing up to 750 eggs incubating a fresh new load of up to 750 spiderlings in just 14 to 30 days. Worse still, each venomous arachnid lives—no, mates and breeds!—inside your home with your children and pets, for up to three full years! Try killing them yourself if you must, but think about this: If you miss killing just one egg-engorged female (or one of her hundreds of nearly microscopic crawling babies), you’ll suffer a full-blown arachnid infestation in no time! I’ve been at war with black widows for the past five years, and there’s nothing worse than feeling something crawling across your skin at night when you’re in bed. Well,

Why be just another person in your industry who does nothing new, nothing worth noting, nothing that gets people talking and buying?

Company A’s headline reads, “MUGGER STOPPER!” and features a close-up of a woman’s hand holding the product as if she were showing you the label. Yawn. I can’t think of another product that offers so much dramatic possibility, yet this company opted to show their product doing...er, nothing at all. Company B, on the other hand, was smart. Their headline, “Stop Muggers at the Push of a Button!” showed an illustration of a woman spraying a group of sleazy-looking attackers who surround her in a semicircle. Each of the thugs is shown in various stages of distress: on their knees, flat on the ground, coughing, grabbing their faces, screaming, and running away.

See what’s happening? The more ways you justify the purchase of your product, the more likely you’ll influence people to buy. So you take them by the hand and tell the whole story. You pile on the benefits (Length-Implies-Strength), show pictures to help them see it, slather on the testimonials (social proof), and back it up with a warranty (to quell fear). By the time you’re done, you have quite a convincing (and often lengthy) sales piece.

Drew: Well nothing! Advertising is not supposed to be entertainment! You may be entertained by it, but that’s not its purpose. It’s not a creativity contest. It’s not meant to grace the walls of the Louvre in Paris. It’s also not poetry, comedy, or a riddle to be figured out. Advertising is not about winning awards for being tricky, off-the-wall, or ingenious. Advertising—plain and simple—is about selling products and services.

But something doesn’t have to be clever or tricky to grab and hold a prospect’s attention. You don’t write copy to appeal to the masses that aren’t buyers for your product as a way to thank them for reading your ad! And those who are interested in the offer don’t need entertainment in order to buy. They need benefits. Facts. An offer. And reassurance that you’ll deliver what you promise.

To wrap up on the obligation piece, this is not “cold hearted”.

If Warren Buffett never became the investor he is today, billions of dollars would go to waste. By signing a giving pledge, he will do more for society by himself than thousands of workers combined. In addition, he can pay for thousands of people to pursue their own dream of working for charities. Just remember, without his donations they wouldn’t be able to work in the first place

All Physical Decisions Compound: Just like investing. If you don’t put in the work to improve your body it will only become harder to do so as you age. Your body has an incredible ability to adapt to new environments and if you take care of your physical health at an early age you will reap the rewards for decades (just like early investing)

Don’t worry about sales funnels if you don’t even have a quality product to sell yet. Don’t worry about calorie counting if your refrigerator is stocked with unhealthy items. Don’t worry about “over training” for your cardiovascular health if you can’t run three miles yet. So on and so forth.

Overachievement is Also Wasted Time: Given that our blog attracts a lot of overachievers, we think many will also recognize the damaging effects of overkill. It is incredibly inefficient to beat a dead horse when no more value can be extracted. As an example, if you score a 90% on a test and the person who receives a 100% obtains the same grade (an A) there is absolutely no point in trying to go to 100%. You should focus your efforts on another test and if 90% is achieved in each one, then move on. The same philosophy applies to business as well. If a specific demographic is no longer giving you the appropriate return on investment, you start looking for a new demographic, create a new product and adjust your strategy

You’re going to create enough stress on your body when you go to the gym, build your career/business and deal with the punches that life throws your way.

Morning: In the morning it is best to load up on proteins. This is the exact opposite of what most people do (eating sugary stuff like cereal). Try to stick with meats, nuts and maybe some fruit. If you’re really having a tough time gaining weight you can switch to more carbs vs. proteins but we would wager the vast majority will benefit from a protein based morning. Beyond the protein aspect we would choose fruits that are acidic. We have no science to back this up only experience. In the morning, try to veer your fruit choices to lemons, limes, oranges and grapefruit. For the more acidic items like lemons/limes go ahead and squeeze them into your glass of water

Roughly speaking, a good pair of shoes cost around $300 (basic Allen Edmonds as an example). In addition, we would then suggest you review your old pair of shoes. Decide if you have more wear and tear in a section of the shoe (typically either the toe or the heel) and install plates which cost practically nothing ($3). Now you’ll have a pair of shoes that will last * at least* 5 years

If you’re able to quickly find the errors in an advertisement we’d then move onto video analysis as well. View commercials and product demonstrations to point out both what went correct, what went wrong and most importantly *why* was it good or bad. Simply saying something is good or bad is not accurate enough… the value is in being able to fix it.Finally, if you’re able to do this well, test your own thesis and create a third party sales page for the product and make a few hundred dollars a month (or substantially more) re-selling the product on a separate landing page

Play Lie Detection: This is another immensely valuable skill. Being able to tell if a person’s statements are true or false. Instead of running around asking a billion questions to everyone you know we suggest adding this to your daily or weekly routine. You’re going to simply take a topic you know extremely well and ask a person (friend or new acquaintance) “Hey I don’t know anything about XXX can you tell me about it?” Then see how long it takes for them to start making up information. You’ll find that people do not want to admit to being wrong (everyone’s a genius) so you can build a rolodex of facial and body reactions when they go into “making up information” mode. If you’re good at picking up on the “tells” then we know you’ll be excellent in predictive work

Hand Out Harmful Personal Information: No, we don’t mean you go out and give bad advice, instead you are finding out if you can trust person X. This means you take one piece of information that would be “bad” if people knew about it and see if it gets leaked. The trick is to make sure you only tell one person. The second trick, if you want to lean on the safe side, is to give out information that really isn’t true. By doing this you’ll be able to build up character qualities of people you trust. Most people are not trustworthy and this is absolutely fine for social interactions.But… It would be deadly if money is ever involved

Once you take the advice, send them a letter saying thank you and *showing* you took their advice. Show them the before and after result… what your results looked like before and after their recommendation.
